0," A decent if slightly underwhelming start
",7,False,"I'm not one to expect a death/shock/twist every episode and can appreciate a slower more narrative approach in an episode, but this felt like neither and was more of a reflection on what has happened so far.This reflection is felt by many of the characters after the last couple of episodes last season...it's not so much the hurt but rather the unknown and how many of these characters do not know how to move forward.The most interesting scenes were played out at The Wall - with some great dialogue on pride vs. survival (I may have over simplified it here but it was quite powerful stuff, especially in how that climax played out). Also great was the scenes with Varys and Tyrion - this could have been played out with sympathy or regrets or feeling sorry but was very well shown by the main two leads. One of GOT's biggest strengths is the relationships between characters and this one should be great to see develop over the season.In summary, a decent start but you do get the feeling that more is to come in the season!"
1," A solid start to Series Five
",8,True,"This, the first episode of the firth series opens with two young girls walking through the woods to a small shack where they find a woman; one of the girls demands that the woman tell her what will happen in her future. She is told that she will marry the king and have three children who will wear golden crowns and golden shrouds. It then becomes apparent that the girl was Cersei Lannister and she was recalling past events. With her powerful father dead she is certain that the family's enemies are just waiting for the right time to move against them.Across the Narrow Sea Tyrion and Varys have reached Pentos; Varys still believes that Tyrion will have an important role ensuring that the right person ends up on the Iron Throne but Tyrion is just keen to be drunk. In Meereen things aren't going according to plan for Daenerys; one of the unsullied has been murdered while visiting a brothel and she is being petitioned to reopen the fighting pits where combatants would fight to the death; something she finds intrinsically offensive. If that weren't enough her dragons are growing even bigger and don't appear to be controllable.At Castle Black Stannis asks Jon to persuade Mance Rayder to bend his knee and join his forces; Jon is convinced that Mance would rather die than bend his knee. Elsewhere Sansa and Lord Baelish are heading to somewhere far from the capital and Brienne is trying to get Pod to stop travelling with her.While this wasn't as exciting as the previous episode it is still pretty solid; inevitably some time is spent reminding us what has been happening to some, but by no means all, the major characters. It also hints at many things to come; notably introducing a group known as the 'Sons of the Harpy'; a group opposed to Daenerys's rule, another religious group in King's Landing and having Stannis tell us of his plans to liberate the north then the rest of Westeros. This was all fairly interesting even though there wasn't much in the way of action. That isn't to say there was no action; the final scene showing Mance's execution was impressive as was the sight of the dragons, which have grown considerable since we last saw them. As expected the cast do a fine job; Peter Dinklage and Conleth Hill impressed in there scene together as Tyrion and Varys and Ciarán Hinds does a fine job depicting Mance Rayder as he prepares for his unpleasant death he is a character who will be missed. Overall this episode got the fifth season off to a decent start; I look forward to seeing the rest of the season."
2," Good Table Setting
",8,True,"Every once in a while, all literature pauses and takes a breath. With something like this, with as many simultaneous stories as are here, it is good to see where everyone is at. For some there has been a period of time between watching episodes since some do not let a TV series, as fantastic as it is, rule their lives. Nearly all the participants are paused and put in their proper milieu. We see challenges ahead. John Snow continues to be put in positions of sever decision making. The Queen is even more vengeful, after the death of her father. She's smolders and we don't know how she will erupt (oops, mixed metaphor). Littlefinger is off to a place he never specifies with the kidnapped, but willing, heir to the throne. The Wildings are made to see a horror that can only make them more formidable in the future, even with the loss of their leader. And Dany has the dragons and her future in doubt. Sounds like fun times ahead."
3," Basement for the season is constructed
",9,True,"This story starts from where it left, Tyrion coming out of the Wooden box, Cersei and Jamie feeling differently about Tyrion and their father's death. Everything expected happens to Mance Rayder, as John plays a sitting duck in settling the truce. I don't seem to fancy Khaleesi and the charmer Daario Naharis' relationship. It only weaken's the Dragons' Mother's charismatic character. (Probably that's the writers' intent).'Littlefinger' Baelish and Lord Varys get a little more important in this one.Overall it's a great episode, the next one should be about Arya Stark.My Rating - 9/10 -------------------------------Game of thrones directors have unique way of filming and showing the content. They film episodes in tandem and in parallel, showing say 3 stories in one episode and another 3 stories in next episode. This makes the show riveting and fresh and very new scene is about another character. ------------------"
4," The Epic Saga Returns
",9,True,"GoT is back, And it has not fallen in quality as the producers go out of there way, As we see monuments falling of pyramids and almost full grown dragons. I think what I admire about this show is that there is dialog in every episode that is better then the previous, As in this particular episode it was ""Man or woman, Young or old, Lord or peasant. Our choices are the same. We choose light or we choose darkness.""I think the highlight of the episode was Daenerys, The Mother Of Dragons trembled at the sight of what her ""kids"" had turned into, Monsters seems like a suitable word as any. Emilia Clarke plays both a powerful and at the same time innocent character quite nicely, And Daenerys is a strong candidate to take the iron throne."
5," Not remarkable, but good
",7,False,"By the time of season 5, the best of GAME OF THRONES was in the past, at least in terms of season consistency (although the show would still go on to have some episodes which surpass the quality overall of earlier ones). Season 5 is one I remember as being particularly weak, at least early on, although this opening episode isn't too bad. I don't think the flashback at the start is a good idea, but the rest works very well. The scenes at Castle Black are particularly good when focusing on the new dynamics between Jon, Stannis, Alliser and Mance, and the new threat in Meereen has plenty of potential."
6," In my opinion, wrong way to start the new season of the ""best show ever""
",5,False,"I'm just going to get it out of the way: yes, I have read the books. Yes, I prefer them to the show. But still, I understand that the books cannot be adapted word by word into a TV show. And still, WHAT THE HELL WAS THIS EPISODE? Can anybody answer me this: WHAT HAPPENED? I mean, storyline wise, WHAT HAPPENED? I have an answer: NOTHING. Nothing happened in this episode. Nothing of relevance. The only thing was the ending, where something actually did happen. But otherwise? Nothing at all happened. It was like ""oh look, there is Cersei. Oh look, there is Tyrion. Oh look, that's Tywin corpse."" And? ""Nothing, there they are. You missed them, didn't you?"" OK, so you might say: this is the ""the-board-is-set"" episode, where they hint at us what could happen in the next. BUT NO. None of the scenes in this episodes where of any relevance. This episode might have been a ""webisode"" and it would have worked so much better. Because, you know what? They say this is the best series ever. The best series ever contains ten episodes per season. And they spend one of those ten on this? On another subject: Weiss and Benioff stated that they broke their rule of ""no-flashbacks"" because it would work. Well guess what? IT DID NOT. That useless scene of Cersei's flashback omitted the only reason of it's existence: (yes, as a person who has read the books, I'm going to say it) SPOILER ALERT! So, Maggy (the witch) tells Cersei ""you will not wed a prince, but a king"". We know what she meant: she would not marry Rhaegar Targaryen, but Robert Baratheon. She tells her ""your husband will have 20 children, you will have three"". We also know what that meant: Robert had many bastards, and Cersei had three illegitimate children. She also tells her ""you will be queen for a while, but then a younger one will come"". Yes, we also know what that meant: she's the queen, and then along comes Margery. We all know these because all of it are stated facts in the TV Show. We have seen them. SO WHAT WAS THE BLOODY POINT IN OMITTING THE OTHER THING MAGGY TELLS CERSEI?! WE ALREADY KNEW ALL OF THAT SHE TOLD HER!!! What was the point in not-showing that Cersei also asks Maggy how is she going to die?! Because, evidently, that's something we, the viewers, don't know!!! I hope they add THAT part in future episodes, because otherwise, I go back to my main point: in these episode absolutely nothing happened. Every scene was just a ""fill-in"" scene.What a terrible way to start the new season...."
7," A Very Assured and Confident Opener.
",10,True,"MAJOR BOOK SPOILERS BELOW!Game of Thrones Premieres are always hindered by the fact that they have a lot of characters to catch up with and a lot of new characters to introduce. This episode was thankfully astute enough to not include every principle character and to not introduce any new ones (Dorne will be visited in episode 2) making it stand out from previous premieres that jump around too much.Already in the 1st episode you can see the things David and Dan have been talking about during the press tour. The episode does indeed, include the 1st flashback scene in the show's history, story lines that take characters on alternate routes to get to where they are in the books and the death of a character who lives past this point in the books. From this episode you can already see the season set up for many of the main characters, which is the hallmark of a great premiere.From the flashback you can already see the war that will play out between Cersei and Margaery that is the defining storyline of A Fest For Crows. Margaery's scene with Loras set up this war of noble women further and alluded to scheming from Margaery that wasn't present in the book. The reintroduction of the now religiously fanatical Loras foreshadows the role religion is going to play in this rivalry also.The Tyrion and Varys scenes were brilliant and more importantly than revealing Varys' motives, revealed that Aegon has been cut and his story has melded with Daenerys'. The brief scene between Sam and Gilly set up Jon Snow becoming Lord Commander and Sam's role in enabling this because Sam now has a motive to empower a Lord Commander that is sympathetic to the Wildlings rather than the Wildling hate Alliser Thorne. This episode makes it clear that Jon would be one such Lord Commander because not only did the episode briefly hint at Melisandre's fascination with him and her subsequent prophecy, but it also foreshadowed his plans to incorporate the Wildlings into the Nights Watch and his eventual but dubious demise. Davos' observation about Jon's burial of Ygritte and Jon's mercy killing of Mance set this up nicely.With Daenerys it's clear that they're going off book in regards to her connection to Tyrion and other matters. However, there is subtle foreshadowing of events that happen to her in the books. The introduction of The Sons of The Harpy and the reintroduction of Hizdahr provide this. It's clear that Daenerys will be in a season long conflict with this group and the main foreshadowing in relation this, comes from Hizdahr's lines about compromise, ruling happy rather than angry subjects and respecting traditions. From this it's clear that Daenerys will lose this conflict and be forced to compromise with the Sons by marrying Hizdahr (Which she does in the books) a man of the Sons culture, showing that she respects their traditions and making them happier in the process.It's quite obvious that the Littlefinger and Brienne stories are going off book. However, the episode does suggest that Sansa and Littlefinger are going North so that Littlefinger can control the North through Sansa's heritage.Ultimately, the title of The Wars To Come is very appropriate as the wars between Stannis and Roose, Cersei and Margaery and Daenerys and The Sons Of The Harpy were all set up. This premiere had great acting, writing, foreshadowing, sex and violence making it a masterful season opener."
8," After Several Months, Disappointing Beginning of Season
",7,False,"Cersei comes to the funeral of her father Tywin Lannister and blames her brother Jaime for his death. Tyrion arrives at his destination transported in a wooden box and Lord Varys discloses that Jaime had asked him to save his brother. White Rat is murdered in a brothel and Daenerys asks Grey Warm to find the killer. She visits her dragons in the dungeons but they do not respect her. Jon Snow is training a teenager, but Melisandre brings him to talk to Stannis Baratheon. He assigns Snow to convince Mance Rayder to bend his knees for him and make his people fight with his army. Will Mance accept the deal?After several months waiting for the return of ""Game of Thrones"", the beginning of this season is disappointing. There is nothing important in this episode showing a total lack of inspiration of the writers and director. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""The Wars to Come"""
9," 'The Wars To Come' - Excellent opener for the new season
",10,True,"Season 5 of the highly anticipated TV-series 'Game of Thrones' starts quite macabre. We see a young Cersei, visiting a fortune teller. Cersei asks for her future but she doesn't get the answers the expected to get. Then we see her in a wagon, riding to the Sept of Baelor. There she says goodbye to her father, who recently passed away. She blames her brother for this. Later, we see Tyrion arriving in Pentos. There's nothing really important about the scene, but Tyrion's acting there was entertaining. We go to Meereen, where an unsullied is killed by a Son of the Harpy. This already sets the tone for the new season! It's starting to get intense. We move on to Sansa, who's watching Robyn's stumbling training. Littlefinger is up to something and we badly want to know want. And then, her way crosses with Brienne of Tarth. I am curious how that will play out. Normally I am not a fan of the Wall but Stannis's presence really makes it interesting. The scenes at the Wall might be the best thing about this episode! Later, we see another scene of our beloved Queen of Dragons. She shares the bed with Daario Naharis and she visits her 'angry' dragons again. Beautiful scene! Cersei also sees Kevan Lannister and his son, Lancel Lannister again. This was the surprise of the episode. What a metamorphose.. And he doesn't seem to be the clumsy boy anymoreWhat did I like about this episode + The prophecy flashback: Good way to start with Cersei's arc, which might be the central arc of this season + Meereen: Great scenes (Dragons, Harpy is taken down, Throat slit of the unsullied man). + The Wall: The execution scene of Mance Rayder (really intense!) + Littlefinger's plan: What is he up to? What did I not like about this episode: Brienne and Podrick scene was boring and not necessary Tyrion and Varys scene: quite boring. Nice to see that Varys finally lays his cards on the table!Overall result: 8,5/10 'The Wars to Come' is in my opinion the best season premiere yet. It begins with a 'small' BOOM."
10," show does something IMMENSELY right
",9,True,"As RavenGlamDVDCollector, I am not really here for the story, No, I am that pseudo stage-door-Johnny bringing flowers for the actresses. But I must speak up, give credit where credit is also due.Much of my contributions for IMDb is usually before having seen the entire episode, and I noticed that other reviewer going ""disappointing start, nothing significant happens"" and at about midway, I kinda saw it was down from the previous season, thought this bit of me having jumped (however belatedly) onto the GAME OF THRONES bandwagon, full fury and throng, well, now it's past the apex anyway, like other reviewers say, bah...Fortunately though, turns out, not the case...This show does something IMMENSELY right. Look, I'm here for the actresses. I joined up for the beauty of Emilia Clarke. GAME OF THRONES was suggested to me by a friend who showed me a sneak preview in the knowledge I'd flip my lid. You get the picture, I'm sure you do.But I've recently had one of my few deviations in my reviews when I praised Peter Dinklage's performance in that episode last season, his confrontation in court with Tywin. I've just realized that something similar happened here. This is all about respect.Mance Rayder wasn't even that much liked by myself up till now, but I'm glad to report that on a freezing cold winter's morning (I call it my GAME OF THRONES Winter Is Coming The Wall Sensurround), here I sit with tears in my eyes. Like Ser Allister, when the chips were down, this guy really showed how to fly the flag.You will have to watch for yourself. I'm not giving the outcome away.A powerful word is invoked here. Respect. This show, through sparse scenes with a vast multitude of characters, achieves greatness beyond what I could possibly convey. These characters, whether good or bad, that doesn't matter... They're destined to be immortal legends in this modern classic.Coming from me, here for the actresses, much, much impressed by these stellar performances, this is the HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION.So scr*w the other reviewer... :)"
11," Who Said Anything About Him?
",8,True,"I really like that not only did I feel a tremendous amount of tension in 'The Wars to Come', but we picked up where each character left off. It served as a nice bridge from season 4's epic finale to the inevitably crazy season 5. Luckily we got at least one scene with every major character, as the first episode of each season usually does, so I immediately felt like Game of Thrones never left.We began tonight with our first true flashback sequence involving Cersei. From what I hear this season will have plenty more flashbacks so I look forward to possibly seeing old characters come back or just younger version of characters who we already know. We did see one last glimpse of Tywin, who lays dead with fake eye balls. I found it fitting that they went right from that scene to Tyrion's eyes looking through the box on the ship. Tyrion is liking going down a darker path this year, but knowing there's a possibility of him meeting up with Daenerys is all the more intriguing. Speaking of her, not sure how much I like the relationship with Naharis as i'm definitely missing Jorah's presence.Jon Snow is having a rough time dealing with his new life with the 'King's presence and Melisandre's increasingly creepy seductiveness. The death of Rayder clearly had an impact on him and I can definitely see conflict rising between Snow and Baratheon in the future. Brienne gave us a good short scene where yet again we have a close encounter with a Stark. I haven't read the books but can there really be this many 'almost' meetings between characters who are looking for each other? Daenerys tried to 'tame' her dragons at the end, and it sure seemed like this wont be the end of that particular conflict. From the trailers alone we see her dragons disobeying her so we may finally get the dragon violence and action that everyone has been craving. So tonight's episode did just about everything right in it's hope to build the tension with all the characters and future story lines. Let the wars begin.+Tyrion meeting Daenerys? +Enter the dragons +Feel the tension +Brienne is always BA -Close encounters -Naharis 8.6/10"
12," Good souls are still amongst the living, dwindling the number might be
",8,True,"More than a few characters suffer from the patricide of last season. Strangely, Tyrion suffers the most while Cersei seems numbed by the whole ordeal. Despite being in mental slump, it is rather surprising to see that he lands in an exotic place. Lord Varys also accompanies him, he invests so much on Tyrion's survival and although he describes his intention in flowery words, there's always a lingering sense that ulterior motive still resides.The first episode sets a good tone for many characters, but bulk of it is spent on Daenerys and Jon Snow. After conquering and liberating cities and its occupants, Daenerys finds that the task of keeping the peace could be even harder. Some opposition force stalk her and her people from shadow, this time she can't sic mercenaries or dragons at them. It's an interesting part of her character as she puts a brave front as queen and can still be fragile at times, the show continuously uses this contrasting values as allure.Jon Snow rebuilds the wall, he's in a strange yet serendipitous position between Stannis and Mance. The two strong personalities are clashing, it seems that after scraping and resorting to dubious means for the better half of the series Stannis has become a force to reckon with. The North now is a momentary home for several armies, coalition or collision could spark at any moment since Stannis has bigger ambition and needs resource for that cause.A few other characters make a brief yet notable appearances. While the episode doesn't show much, it's still nice to see them, all breathing and such. The series has high production value, and the fifth season is no different. The stages are beautiful to behold and a couple of spectacles are nothing short of breathtaking. Costume and setting have been polished for medieval, desert and winter style respectively, although I'm not a fans of Tyrion's beard.Alliances, though they are uncanny, might be forged. The prospect of the bonds, as well as the characters who might share them, are fascinating hook for episodes to come."
13," Literature vs The Series
",8,True,"I couldn't care less if the Series is diverging from the Literature: the books are not canonical texts (neither I would bother if they were); I couldn't care less about disputing which one is the chosen one: the source will always be the ""best"" because it was the first and it's the basis for the inspiration... well, that's subjective, but hey... I couldn't care less! We readers and viewers have to understand that one thing is a book, another thing is an audiovisual work. Both have merits on their own and both use different languages to speak for themselves. What comes first comes first, but I couldn't care less. After all the author is blessing the series, even directing some episodes, and he is all smiles about its route, so... why whining? What matters for me is quality, its juice - narrative with excellence. A story with layers and layers of reviving itself from the ashes, the mighty test of enduring when being hammered in flames, the plausibility of a character's metamorphosis (our own in life), the prevailing string of a persona's charisma: Shakespearean political plots vs. Humanism.That's what you will find in this episode. Forget about hysterical plot turmoils, Hollywood agendas and frantic compasses. You'll only find a solid narrative with delightful clues for the ""Wars to Come"". When you reaffirm the protocols of seeing good old ""Game of Thrones"" again and for the 5th time the episode has already finished leaving you with a watery eye. Son of a...!"
14," A great start to the fifth season
",9,True,"Now that I've reviewed four seasons, this episode and some of the later episodes of season 5 is where I watched Game of Thrones on television. Because, like I said before when I reviewed Season 1, I had to catch up with the entire show online. So, with that out of the way, time to review Season 5 starting with this one.The Wars to Come continues where Season 4 left off with the two Stark girls heading off in different directions Arya and Sansa while Tyrion with the help of Varys arrive at Pentos after escaping from the Lannister family after being sentenced to death. Also, Jon Snow is continuing his duties at the Wall before two kings arrive, which finds himself caught.The first episode of Season 5 is a great episode. The performances are still good, the storyline's nicely written, the new characters are well-introduced, and the pacing never drags. My only quibble is that it doesn't quite live up to the high standards set by Season 4.Don't get me wrong. The writing's fine for the most part, but the reason I think Season 4 was the best because it raised the stakes to the events that would happen to some of the Lannister family members, the action sequences were engaging, the writing had gotten progressively stronger, and the character development was even more fleshed out.But while this episode isn't excellent, it's a great start to season 5 and looking forward to see how things will turn out."
15," What a boring mess
",4,False,"Warning, major spoilers to follow, if you haven't read the books, do NOT read this.After completely cutting Lady Stoneheart and adding meaningless, out of place scenes to the finale of the previous season I was quite wary with the premiere of this one. People who have read the books will agree that introducing Lady Stoneheart was the perfect cliffhanger for ""A storm of swords"", but she was cut from the series, even though she plays a major role in the book which season 5 is based on.I can see how, maybe postponing her appearance might help the show, but why are they then premiering the new season with meaningless dialog, and outright stupid changes to the story?Why are we seeing Tyrion in the first episode? he adds nothing of value to it, his dialog with Varys is completely meaningless, and it seems as though they just shoehorned Tyrion and Varys into this episode because they're among the most popular characters. Also, by showing Tyrion we lose the mystery of the books, not knowing where he is, Cersei growing more paranoid by the day, burning down the tower of the hand in the process. We also get to see Dany, who also doesn't really add anything to the story, she sits on her throne and has some guy come in and ask to open up some fight club or whatever, I wasn't even paying attention at this point. Then she goes down to see her dragons, they're pretty mad at her. Alright, so.. what was the point in showing Dany now? She adds nothing to the story, literally nothing, we just see exactly what happened last season, she's left her dragons in a cellar, and now they're mad at her.At this point my jaw is almost dislocated from yawning so much, but hey here's Jon, surely this must be good right?Yeah, it's alright. We see Mance get burned and Jon shoots him to show him mercy. No complaints about this scene, there's some trivial changes but hey, I don't really care about those.So all in all, it's a boring mess of filler dialog, with too much show time given to the actors with the highest salary, all for the purpose of ""Hey look, it's Tyrion guys! you love Tyrion, right?""The creators of the show have changed so many things from the books, almost abandoning them, to the point where it is spiraling out of a control and turning into a complete mess. They should have stuck to copying the books."
16," The Outcome of War and the Wars to Come
",8,True,"""The Wars to Come"" is indeed a massive setup for the wars and events to come in this season. A lot of characters are about to meet and a lot of stronger forces are about to compete for the throne. Yet another season arrives, and this kicks it all off.The episode starts off with a flashback regarding Cersei eager to find out about her future and of course gets what she bargained for. It's a strong flashback that adds more depth and development to Cersei's current character in the show. The episode also instantly follows the events of the previous season and it instantly shows their outcome to the different characters throughout the kingdom. We also get to see Tyrion with Varys and their conversations together have always proved to be interesting throughout the seasons so it was entertaining to see them together again. It was also exciting that we finally get a Daenerys and Tyrion storyline crossover and it would be nice to see both of my favorite story lines to intertwine. Meanwhile at the Wall where Stannis now resides. Jon Snow is troubled as Stannis wants the help of the Wildling army to march into Winterfell and gives them a more than fair offer in return as long as Mance kneels down to him. In the end, a tense situation was brought upon Mance and audiences alike whether he would rather kneel or burn. He did not kneel and was steadfast in his decision, that was until the fire wavered upon him and Jon ended his despair with a shot of an arrow. Meanwhile with the Daenerys storyline, a masked man had murdered one of her men and she sought out to find the culprit. Dany seem to have been having a lot of trouble since the previous season, so she ought to reclaim her authority with her dragons which she locked up for about 1 season. In a big surprise, the dragons seemed to have despised her for locking them up and are furious at her. The problems and inconveniences seem to be stacking up in Dany's part and there's bound to be more. Let's just hope Tyrion fixes some of those problems when he arrives. The visuals were still looking classy and incredible and the dialogue and acting were still game of thrones standardsAs a setup, it sure did promise a whole lot to happen in this season and I hope it to be right. There's bound to be more deaths and shocking moments and for that I'm very excited for. +Cersei Flashback, +Outcome of Season 4, +A promising setup, +Stannis and Jon, +Tyrion and Dany, +Intense moments,Verdict: 8.3/10"
17," A slightly slow start
",8,True,"The episode starts off well, but to me it doesn't really pick up enough speed. I find it a good, but not great start of the new season."
18," Sets up what is to come quite effectively
",8,True,"Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.""The Wars to Come"", while not living up to the previous season's finale ""The Children"", is a very promising start for Season 5. It is not the most dramatic, action-packed, story-advancing or most emotion-filled of episodes, instead going the slower, more reflective and intimate approach. This is not a problem because, although some may disagree, 'Game of Thrones' has shown numerous times that it does these types of episodes excellently. Some characters are better developed than others, Tyrion continues to have plenty of meat to him and is getting more fascinating with each episode. Am also really appreciating Cersei getting more development and becoming more prominent. Sansa is rather bland though.The episode does a great job beginning where the previous season left off, reminding us of what happened and sets things up for what is to follow. There is not a massive amount in terms of character progression however, though it's certainly evident if not quite deep enough, and other episodes have done better in moving things forward.'Game of Thrones' has always been strong when it comes to acting and ""The Wars to Come"" is not an exception. Peter Dinklage can do no wrong, he is a fan favourite for great reason, and Lena Headey, Aidan Gillen and Emilia Clarke also do a huge amount with their characters.Visually, ""The Wars to Come"" looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. The visual effects are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about ""The Wars to Come"" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is once again. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions. The story is still riveting, even with the quieter and slower approach to the storytelling, and has enough passion and sensitivity. Overall, promising start to Season 5. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
19," powerful beginning
",9,True,"I was a fan of ""Game of thrones"" first season. After death of Eddard Stark (Sean Bean) I lost previous interest for some reasons, mostly because of huge number of characters and subplots. I watched all the seasons but not joyfully. I was planning to continue watching like this, but something happened.The day before season 5 premiere I watched ""Game of thrones: a day in life"". It is a behind the scene short movie. Great amount of accessories and number of cast & crew was astonishing. I was really impressed which changed my point of view.Besides, although there is no ""previously on..."" in s5 e1 but, wisely, the past events are narrated by characters, for example death of Tyrion's mistress by himself and so on just in time. We also see all of main characters except Arya (Lord Stark daughter), I guess. Game of thrones fifth season had a powerful beginning. I wish (and I am sure) all the fans will be satisfied"
20," A Good Start.
",8,True,"A lot of new character's purpose, story are moving forward and building up to the War to come."

",9,True,This episode is very good one of the best in season 5
22," Review of season 5: Episodes 1-2
",8,True,"Greetings from Lithuania.Both first episodes of season 5 are 8/10 in my opinion. While the story haven't moved drastically or very intriguingly, it's still a show to wait and to admire. The production values here are like no other - you can simply watch this show for production values - they are truly create this rich world.Acting was as usually very solid from everyone involved. Directing is good, but this show has seen better, as well as writing. It's good, but not as good as it gets and this show has featured some series that were as good as they could possibly be.Overall, season 5 started good, but not great. I know that it's a slow burner start which will definitely lead us to a great and unforgettable moments, so it has to build it on something, and this ""something"" are these first two episodes."
23," Power Struggle
",9,True,"It's quite clear that this show has been about the struggle for power, and it always has been. But I really like the episodes that particularly focus on that. Jon Snow, (possibly Jon Stark?), is somewhat unwillingly to take on another leadership role. Cersei struggles with the council, Tyrion misses the power, and Daenerys grapples with the right punishments. Even though there wasn't a whole lot of action, I loved tonight's episode. It was another one of the great dialogue episodes that the writers consistently give us. Whether it was Tyrion and Varys talking about the lack of power and what people do with it, or Stannis continuing to tempt Snow with possible leadership titles, it was a well written and directed episode.Arya arrived in Braavos to the House of Black and White only to find her old pal Jaqen H'gar! Obviously not reading any of the books I was quite pleasantly surprised to see him appear for the first time since season 2. Speaking of Starks, Brienne finally met Sansa Stark. Sadly, much like Arya, she wasn't too open to her protection. You have to feel for Brienne. She has spent the last few years trying to find the Stark girls and yet neither of them welcomed her. Fingers crossed they change their mind in the future. Jaime and Bronn are apparently on a trip to retrieve Myrcella from the Viper's wife and brother. I'm starting to really like these unlikely duos that go on adventures together. Brienne and Jaime, The Hound and Arya, and now Jaime and Bronn.It was once again really fun to watch Jon Snow and Stannis in the same scene. The characters that you grow to care about for seasons finally meeting is extremely fulfilling. Which is why it will be incredibly once Dany and Tyrion meet. Dany is really struggling with her power and the problem of the Sons of the Harpy. I would hope Tyrion and Varys would fill the gap that Jorah has left Dany in helping with the many political decisions that go along with leading these people. Hopefully next week will be that week.+Stannis & Snow's interactions +Power struggle +Unlikely duos +H'gars return -Brienne can't catch a break 9.0/10"
24," More plot development and more action
",9,True,As this episode opens we see Arya Stark for the first time this season; she has arrived in the city of Braavos and gone to the House of Black and White where she hopes to be reunited with Jaqen H'ghar she doesn't get the reception she hoped for; the man at the door claims that there is nobody of that name there. After a night in the rain she heads into town and later on is confronted by a trio who think she will be an easy victim; this leads to her meeting Jaqen H'ghar and finally entering the House of Black and White. In Meereen a member of the Sons of the Harpy is captured; Daenerys is inclined to have him executed; something the freed slaves are keen to see. She is counselled against this course of action and agrees to hold a trial; however Mossador kills the prisoner believing that this is what Daenerys really wants. This leads to him being tried and executed something the people are not happy about and for once Daenerys sees what it means to be unpopular with 'her people'. Elsewhere in Essos Tyrion and Varys are continuing their journey to Meereen.Back in Westeros Cersei is worried about her daughter; she is in Dorne and there are people there who are determined to have revenge on the Lannisters for the death 'The Viper'. Jaime offers to head south on a rescue mission; to this end he enlists the help of Bronn. Elsewhere Brienne and Podrick bump into Sansa and Petyr Baelish in a tavern; Brienne offers her services to Sansa but they are rejected. North at Castle Black Stannis offers to make John Snow Lord of Winterfell and give him the name John Stark but he won't renounce the oath he made to the Night's Watch. It is also time to elect a new Commander of the Night Watch; Alliser Thorne is expected to win but Sam proposes that John would make a better leader.I felt that this season started well but this episode is a step up from the opening instalment. It was great to see Arya again; Maisie Williams does a great job in the role. There is a decent amount of action; most notably when Brienne crosses swords with some of Lord Baelish's men. As well as actual action there is promise of more to come with Jaime and Bronn heading south to Dorne to rescue Myrcella. In Dorne we are introduced to Doran Martell; the local ruler who is played by Alexander Siddig of 'Star Trek: DS9' fame. The events in Meereen are amongst the episodes most interesting as we see Daenerys struggling to do the right thing even if it makes her unpopular. Her missing dragon also makes a welcome reappearance although it remains to be seen whether it will come under her control. The events on the wall are interesting and after the election of the new Commander it will be interesting to see how those who didn't support him behave. There is also a nice scene between Gilly and Stannis's daughter; nothing dramatic but it was nice to see some normal interaction amongst all the plotting and power-play. Overall a good episode.
25," And so the plot thickens...
",8,True,"Second episode in and this time the story telling is a lot better and more engrossing. We continue to see the struggles from nearly all the characters, some trying to keep hold of what power they have (Cersei, Danerys) others trying to keep hold of what they believe their purpose is (Brienne, Arya) and others who are unsure of what they want (Tyrion, Jon Snow). Highlights in particular were the election/voting at The Wall (where you knew Jon Snow would win that - as the people's vote!) and the scenes with Danerys. I'm sure i'm not the only one, but I really wanted Jon to take that offer from Stannis, but knew deep down that is too good to be true. Should be interesting to see how that plays out for Jon and Stannis.For Danerys, her glorious rise to power and overtaking other kingdoms was starting to become repetitive but now we actually start to see her losing her status of Mhysa, from the people and her dragons! It'll be fascinating to see if she can recover from this.Great to see a couple of familiar faces back too, in Bronn and Jaqen! With such a massive cast, it's no surprise, but always fun to see them back after a while.In summary, a good episode with more plot development!"
26," John Snow and his Evolution
",9,True,"There is more jockeying for position in this episode. Our favorite Dwarf continues to feel sorry for himself, not seeing what he had become. He has betrayed his own integrity. We know, of course, that when the pity party is over, he is the person with the most character in the entire series. The Queen mother continues to overstep her bounds and is not getting an easy path, but she really wields a lot of power and is filled with venom. John Snow continues to move toward a place of equality. His bastard status haunts him and he now can remove it if he only sells himself out. A big question ahead. Arya has finally been brought to her destination, but she isn't sure what is going to happen. Littlefinger meets Brienne and needs to realize that she is incredibly committed to her vows, even though she has been mistreated all along. He, her adversary, should know that one who puts fear aside becomes incredibly dangerous. Dany may have made a great misstep but she feels she must maintain her power position. She now turns to fear. A really intriguing episode."
27," Preamble of the Fifth Season
",8,True,"Arya Stark sails to Braavos and arrives at the House of Black and White to seek out Jaqen H'ghar; however she is not welcomed to enter in the house and she throws her coin away into the sea. Brienne and Podrick are eating in a tavern and she contacts Sansa and Little Finger, but Sansa refuses to follow Brienne. The men that are escorting Little Finger and Sansa unsuccessfully hunt Brienne and Podrick down on the road. Cersei shows to Jaime that their daughter Myrcella is in danger and Jaime seeks out Bronn and makes an offer for him to travel with him to Dome. In Meereen, the Son of Harpy is captured and Daenerys has a meeting with her leaders to decide his fate. Barristan advises her to give a fair trial to the man; however Mossador disrespects her order and kills the Son of Harpy. Daenerys sentences him to death and there is a riot in Meereen. Jon Snow is invited by Stannis Baratheon to serve him; in return, he would give the North to Jon and he would be Jon Stark, Lord of Winterfell. But Job Snow turns the invitation down and he is chosen to be the new Commander of the Night Watch. Arya is finally invited to come to the House of Black and White.by Jaqen H'ghar. ""The House of Black and White"" is the preamble of the Fifth Season. The destiny of Arya in Braavos is a mystery. Sansa seems to be lost following Little Finger. The journey of Jaime and Bronn will certainly be full of action. Daenerys is following the path of her father. Let's see how Jon Snow will deal with Janos and Alliser Thorne. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""The House of Black and White"""
28," The House of moral complexity
",9,True,"Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.There are still signs of settling, understandably, with Season 5's second episode ""The House of Black and White"", but it is an improvement over the still very promising and well done season opener ""The Wars to Come"". It is a very daunting task living up to the consistently exceptionally high standard of Season 4 and this very early stage of Season 5 is doing a noble job on that front. What makes ""The House of Black and White"" a superior episode is that there is a bigger and bolder approach to the storytelling, rather than the slower, quieter and reflective tone of ""The Wars to Come"". There are more and bigger character moments (especially with Jon Snow and Brienne), characters having moral complexities, intensity-building and there is more emotion and drama. A better job is done advancing the story and character progressions while building upon the events of ""The Wars to Come"". Loved that there was more of Arya and Bronn, neither wasted, and Dorne is a worthy addition. All the acting is never less than very strong, can't think of a weak link here.Visually, ""The House of Black and White"" looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. The visual effects are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about ""The House of Black and White"" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is once again. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions. The story is still riveting, with plenty of passion and sensitivity.Summing up, the season has not quite settled yet but there is more than enough to make one convinced to keep watching. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
29," Another great episode for the fifth Game of Thrones season
",9,True,"The House of Black and White is another great episode in the fifth Game of Thrones season.Yes, the pacing did drag a bit longer, but what it fails in pacing it makes up for it by advancing the plot progression a bit nice. The performances are still great, the storyline/script continue to be well-written, the directing and editing is well-focused, the scenery is still gorgeous to look at, the sets and costumes are still lavish, the music score from Ramin Djawadi is still beautiful, and the relationships continue to shine. So, overall, another great episode in the fifth season. :)"
30," Young girls on distant lands
",8,True,"A collective cheer from viewers can be heard echoing as Arya Stark graces the scene safely. The city of Braavos is exquisite, both streets and rivers swerve as its vein while its buildings stand firmly in rigid tone. Different from the rest of story takes place, Braavos looks like an archaic tough monument. It's quite incredible how the show can produce such gallery of architectural glitz.My heart goes for Brianne though, even with the best intention, honor and will she can't seem to get any of the Stark girls to trust her. Apparently, after the ordeal they have endured trust is a rare commodity, understandably so. House Martell has a brief turn, discontent is clearly present as Oberyn was killed during trial by combat. It also presents another notable view of a particular garden, the nobles certainly have it good.Jaime is now preoccupied as he tries to save one of his remaining children. There's a change about him, a sad one. He doesn't look lively at all this season. No sudden lust, no smile and no witty quip either, the last one is definitely prove of stress. Jon Snow finds himself in brighter light, despite a series of unfortunate events he's had, he currently in receiving end of high favor, although how he accept it is another matter.Much of the episode highlights Daenerys' struggle to keep her city and people save. There's no ultimate right or wrong decision for her to take, generations of slavery and prejudice are hard to purge no matter how beautiful her speech is or how her men are committed to this cause. If there's anything to comfort her, she has myriad of allies on her side.Regardless of their potential perilous situations, many characters have come to terms with their relocations and hope that happier prospect would be brought by next episode."
31," You have to earn the entry to the house of black and white
",9,True,"The episode starts where it last left. Arya is angry at the Black and White (CGI) building in pursuit of . Confused Snow, Conspicuous Unsullied mark this episode. In the previous episode we see Daenerys/ Mhysa (now) is confused and is afraid she is not able to control her dragons. Her woes continue. Extrapolating to her rule, it's tentative as well. She is weaker than ever and is confused on what to do. We get to see a bit of the water gardens.What bothers me is they give very less screen time to the poor Arya Stark. Despite that fact this is a good episode. Something heavy is up for Cersei and Tyrion. An exciting episode 3 is on it's way.Overall Rating - 8.5/10"

Cersei and Jaime speak of their children, Jaime sets out on a mission to get back their daughter and finds Bronn to help.7/10"
33," Very similar to the first episode
",7,False,"THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE is another solid episode with the most drama taking place at Castle Black once again. There's some heavy exposition here and the setting up of plots to come which is quite obvious when re-watching this. The material in Meereen also has greater significance when compared to what comes later. Unfortunately this is also the episode where we're first introduced to the Spanish-style Dorne, which looks pretty but ends up the most unfulfilling sub-plot of the whole show."

",8,True,Almost nothing new in this episode. Story is moving forward without surprise. But i like the Cercei's part.
39," Absolute Beauty
",9,True,"To begin with, there are great developments that are happening through this episode. If you are into a song of ice and fire, and game of thrones, you will love this one. Personally, I love Jon Snow, and just now, he is in his first test as a leader. He must listen to Stannis Baratheon advice, that if people don't fear you they will not follow you. Sansa must take an ultimate decision. Believe me, every episode is better than the one before. Queen Margery ensures that the new King Tommen Baratheon, the lean heart king, will be her, not the Queen Regeant, Cersei Lannister. Theon Greyjoy is truly lost now. Can not wait for the next episodes."
40," There Is no Justice in the World
",8,True,"Arya is serving Jaqen H'ghar cleaning the House of Black and White and not as his apprentice as she expected to be. Cersei comes to the marriage of her son Tommen and Margaery in King's Landing and he discloses that her mother asked him to not trust anyone. He asks Cersei whether she misses Casterly and then she meets Margaery. In the North, Theon listen to the conversation of Cerwin Roose Bolton and his son Ramsey about the best way to control the North through marriage. Little Finger and Sansa Stark head to Winterfell and he discloses his scheme against the Bolton, marrying her with Ramsey to seek revenge. Brienne follows Sansa and Little Finger and tells his life to Podrick and she tells that she will teach him how to fight. She also tells that she wants revenge against the death of King Renly. In Castle Black, Jon Snow meets Stannis and refuses his invitation to be the Lord of North. He tells that he will follow as Commander of the Night Watch. Stannis advises him to get rid of his enemies in Castle Black. Arya Stark throws her possessions away but the Needle that she hides in the rocks by the sea.

The group of High Sparrow promotes attacks sinners in King's Landing and Cersei meets High Sparrow and makes a deal with him. Tyrion is abducted in a brothel.""High Sparrow"" is the greatest episode so far of this Fifth Season. All the segments are important and show the search of power by many characters. Cersei makes a deal with High Sparrow giving power to his fanatic group and controlling King's Landing. Jon Snow follows the advice of Stannis and gets rid of his greatest enemy in Castle Black. Sansa begins to follow the Machiavellian plot of Little Finger to retrieve the lands of her family. Arya is finally accepted to serve the Many-Faced God. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""High Sparrow"""
41," Second Gear
",6,False,"This episode gets a six simply because we are at the point where stuff needs to happen. Not start happening, actually happen. I feel like Arya with that darned broom, watching things almost occur. One thing is building up suspense, another is addiction to filler. If it wasn't for Cersei and Margery hissing at each other, the arrival of the Sparrows, hints of necromancy in the vault and Jon Snow finally growing a pair, this would be a strangely empty episode. No,I don't want to watch Sansa be handed blankly over to another psychopath no I don't want to watch Tyrion ponder his sudden impotence and no I don't want to watch Arya wash dead people's clothes. Even she can't make laundry interesting. Get on with it."
42," A Girl Must Become No One
",9,True,"So Jaime and Daenerys took the week off but the show's quality absolutely did not. It was another week with several great character moments and a great example of just how good this show is with spreading the love to the entire cast. We learned more about the House of Black and White, saw new journeys for Sansa and Tyrion, and had many short but important moments with everyone else.The episode started with Arya doing the dirty work at the house and in turn had to basically give up her name as her first step of training. Throwing her clothes, coin, and nearly her sword into the water was pretty emotional. It just goes to show how long we have been following Arya and how much that sword meant to her. But it was fun to see Arya go off on that one girl and say some words I don't know that we have ever heard her say. We then were taken to the bedroom of Tommen and Margaery. It's clear that the latter doesn't have as much feelings as the former does. It's also clear that the actor sounds so much like Joffrey did and it was quite apparent tonight. Margaery also had a great scene with Cersei in which not a lot was said, but there was a lot that came out of it. Cersei is quickly falling down the ladders of power and Margaery is rising ever so fast. That scene clearly showed those two in their new and improved season 5 form.We then traveled north to visit Sansa and Littlefinger. Finding out that he was planning on having Sansa marry Ramsey was heartbreaking. She has been through arguably the most out of any character on the show and to land with a psychopath like him is tough to see. I hope there are better things to come for Lady Stark. Perhaps Brienne, who is just a few miles out comes in for the rescue? Speaking of Brienne of Tarth, her scene with Podrick reminded us of Stannis' faults and what the man is capable of. But I would like to think he has the best intentions. Once again him and Jon Snow had the best scenes of the episode with the ladder having to reject his offer. Stannis wasn't too pleased but realizes the honor in staying as the leader of the night watch. But as Stannis said, that honor got Ned Stark killed. Even at the end of the episode when Snow stands up and executes that man, it had shades of Ned in season 1. And it definitely mirrored Dany's issues last week.We ended with Tyrion in his quest to head to Meeren and find Dany. To be honest, it's so cool to even hear him say her name out loud. I have to imagine the book readers geek out over that. It's just as fun to watch Varys and Tyrion ride together for a long period of time. The line of ""I'm losing my mind"" or even ""I need to speak to someone with hair"" were hilarious. And finally we find Jorah, who looks to be on the edge, only to take Tyrion prisoner with the line of ""I'm taking you to the queen"". Having not read the books, I'm really interested to see how this plays out. Jorah is not on good terms with Dany and throwing Tyrion in there makes it all the more unpredictable. No matter, I'm definitely looking forward to next week as we are nearly one third of the way into season 5 already! +Arya learning the ways of being no one+Snow & Stannis scenes +Tyrion-Varys banter +Jorah pops up +Queen shift in power -Sansa's endgame seems frustrating 9.0/10"
43," Arya wants to become nobody and Sansa learns who she is to wed
",9,True,"As this episode starts we see Arya inside the House of Black and White; it isn't how she imagined; rather than learning how to fight she is sweeping the floor; it will take time before she can become no one and before she can stop being Arya Stark she will have to dispose of Arya's possessions. Back in King's Landing Margaery marries Tommen; a simpler wedding than when she married his brother but a far happier one. After the High Septon is humiliated by the puritanical 'Sparrows' he demands that Cersei has their leader executed; instead she pays him a visit and tells him that she supports the work of the faithful. At Castle Black Jon Snow once again declines Stannis's offer and must make his first decisions as Commander of the Night's Watch including dealing with a long serving member who refuses to follow an order and seeks to undermine Jon's authority. Further South Sansa learns that she is being taken back to Winterfell where she is to marry Ramsay Bolton. Finally we see that Tyrion and Varys have arrived in Volantis; here Tyrion is recognised by a familiar face who grabs him and tells him that he will be taken to the queen but which queen does he mean; Cersei or Daenerys?There is little in the way of action in this episode but that doesn't stop it being gripping. Once again Maisie Williams excels as Arya; managing to capture both her frustration and determination; the little of what we saw of the activities of the Faceless Men served only to make them more intriguing. Natalie Dormer's Queen Margaery continues to become more interesting; she always seems to be caring and polite but there is constant feeling that she has another agenda. Sansa Stark, played by Sophie Turner, has been a bit of a tragic figure since the death of her father and her betrothal to Ramsay seems to continue that although she seems far more spirited than she once was which only serves to improve her character. The events on the wall were impressive as they showed that Jon has what it takes to be Commander as well as providing the episodes only real action. The Sparrows, and the High Sparrow in particular, look likely to be more interesting in later episodes; largely thanks to Jonathan Pryce playing the High Sparrow. Overall I thought this was a great episode with plenty of interesting character and plot development; I can however understand those who want a little more action being disappointed."
44," Does it get any better ?!
",10,True,"I remember watching the first episode of the season and wondering if the whole season was going to be that dull, but guess what: I was absolutely incredibly wrong! First of all, I liked that both the Stark girls are finally training to be someone in Westeros, both in different places, methods and of course teachers. Then we have a drunk dwarf in a wagon with a eunuch (sounds like a bad joke), riding to meet Daenerys Targaryen, named in this episode ""the savior"" by a red priest like Melissandre, does anyone else smell ""Faith war"" approaching? And talking about faith, we finally see some new trouble starting to erupt in King's Landing, and for those of us that read the books: We know that the problems are just getting started for Cersei Lannister, aka The queen mother. Finally I can say that HBO is doing it right. I can only wonder what's in store for next week, but rest assured, it's going to be awesome!!"
45," Path of throne digger, new leader and wandering foreigner.
",8,True,"Never underestimate the power of honey trap, it's probably more effective than swinging a sword ever could, though it still attracts the piercing of different sword. Margaery enjoys the fruit of her smile and skin, she seems confident as she challenges Cersei with typical in-law banters, subliminally sending crass thoughts and insult of age. If this were a show of different genre, I'd expect the visual filter turns red as Cersei channels her malicious intent silently.Jon Snow resides as Lord Commander, not the title he originally wanted or expected, but he must deal with a series of problem that come with the promotion. Stannis still irks him to join his cause and the incoming issue with the Wildlings must be settled soon. Another change in the North also happens as Sansa finally reaches her destination, it is definitely not what she had in mind, perhaps this one is worse for her to take.Arya is now an apprentice of some sort in Braavos to become nobody. The whole process is very vague, so is the reward. It's unclear if she wants a skill or near supernatural presence, thought at this point any means to her end will be welcomed. This practice proves to be taxing for her, and the ""wax on wax off"" method certainly isn't telling anything. A nod for Brianne as she tells the story of her childhood to her squire, Gwendoline Christie delivers a private and convincing tale.For a pariah on a strange land, Tyrion finds an equally bizarre allure of the people and place. Perhaps, the most surprising revelation is the change on himself. His time for reflection is short as he must use his silver tongue other than to channel liquor. It's certainly a good way to wrap up and built for incoming episode."
46," Bubbling Below the Surface
",8,True,"People are being subversive, planning and conniving. We begin with the marriage of Tommen and Margery. She is such a beautiful, sensual woman, but that sly smile speaks volumes. She has had an agenda for a long time, and now she is the queen. Cersei is relegated to a subservient role, sort of like the queen mother of England. The strength she has, however, is in her alliances. We can't forget that she is a cruel despot who has struck off the heads of many who have crossed her. Margery is planting seeds of dissent and playing Tommen for the child he is. She now wants total control of the castle, hoping to drive Cersei back to her original home. Lots is going on. Arya is now in the House of Black and White, where she is to become some kind of Jedi warrior. She is bossed around by a kind of Christ-like figure who demands she leave her identity behind. Where she is going and what she is to do is a mystery to us. John Snow has been give power and uses it in an act that would have been anathema before. We know it's necessary, but has it spoiled him. Littlefinger maneuvers Sansa into a marriage with a psychopath for political gain. Tyrion oversteps his bounds and this sets up Episode 4."
47," Jumping the shark
",5,False,"In retrospect, I think this is where the show jumped the shark. The decision to marry Ramsey in order to avenge her family was so illogical and meaningless that it could lead to nothing interesting at all. Indeed, so it was. Avenge how? And when? If you want to have revenge against someone that have betrayed and slaughtered almost your entire family, you usually don't decide to marry him, to live with him, to sleep with him, to make children with him (such are the things that married people use to do, Sansa should know it). A clear sign that bad writing was going to prevail more and more. When the episode first aired, one could pretend it was just a bit weird, thus thinking ""let's wait and see"". But then, later the downfall has become more and more massive. This episode is a sort of pivotal element for the dull story lines that will follow in seasons 5 & 6."
48," Here we go!
",9,True,"After two slightly slow episodes, this season of Game of Thrones is picking up full speed. Now the storylines are really starting to engage me."
49," High Sparrow is a solid, albeit not excellent, progression left by the first two
",8,True,"High Sparrow doesn't quite live up to the high standards left by the first two episodes due to the pacing dragging a bit longer and the plot progression, while well-written, isn't furthered, but it makes up for it with some solid performances from the new characters and setting up the events that would later happen in the next seven episodes.The storyline, despite how slow it got, is still good as is the script, the performances from the original cast are still solid especially from Arya and Daenerys, the music score is still beautiful, the scenery is still gorgeous, the sets and costumes continue to be lavish, the directing and editing is still sharp, and the characters continue to be interesting in their relationships as did the new characters.Overall, not excellent, but a solid episode for season 5."

51," High flying
",8,True,"Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.There is less of a still settling feel here in ""High Sparrow"" than there was in particular the Season 5 opener ""The Wars to Come"", as far as previous episodes of the season go, which is a good thing. By all means, it doesn't fully explode, it is not the most action packed or pace-wise exciting of episodes and in comparison to other episodes not a lot feels like it's progressing forward. ""High Sparrow"" nonetheless scores very highly in making the characters interesting, the very adept handling of weaving all the different subplots together and introducing new characters and events promisingly set up. The standouts here are the High Sparrow introduction and the whole storyline with Jon, which has a lot of tense unpredictability.All the acting is strong, 'Game of Thrones' always delivers when it comes to the acting. Maisie Williams, Emilia Clarke and Kit Harrington in particular.Visually, ""High Sparrow"" looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. The visual effects are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about ""High Sparrow"" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is once again. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions. The story is still riveting, with plenty of passion and sensitivity.To sum up, a very good high flying episode indeed but not a 'Game of Thrones' favourite. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
52," Generally works well
",7,False,"HIGH SPARROW is generally an episode that moves this season's plot forward in a variety of ways. Scenes involving the titular character and Arya's new training school are still fresh and involving at the moment, introducing new characters and re-introducing interesting old ones in an inviting way. There are some missteps, including a lengthy ten-minute chat merely to add in exposition for Brienne and Podrick, which I found entirely unnecessary. However, the new political intrigue at Castle Black is handled in a pleasing and mature way, leading to some great moments. A pity Tyrion has gone from being the best character in season four to such an irritation here."
53," Awesome
",10,True,Another exciting episode with lots of action and a great story
54," Tyrion gets all the best lines on this show.
",9,True,"The transformation from Arya Stark to No One is quite emotional to watch, but we're happy Arya gets a new costume this season - she's been in those brown rags far too long."
55," Another regular episode.
",8,True,There are not much to talk about. just building to the end of season.
56," The Only War is Life vs Death
",9,True,"God this show is good. They simply deliver on so many things that people want it's insane. The two road trips were great as we caught up with of Jaimie and Tyrion are doing. We got the beginnings of some serious battles between Daenerys and the Sons of the Harpy, and more progress in Cersei and Snow's respected endeavors. It was a fantastic episode, and probably my favorite of the season so far.Jaimie and Bronn together were so entertaining. It's fascinating to think about how much Jaimie has changed since season 1. When he says he wants to die in the arms of the woman he love, I actually think that's about Brienne. As crazy as it is to think it's not Cerseii, I just think he feels more obligated to Cerseii instead of where his legitimate feelings lie. It's also unlikely he will hurt Tyrion, that's more of him just covering up his tracks to Bronn. Speaking of Cerseii, her scenes this week mostly lied with the council and the High Sparrow. The council is a lot smaller than it used to be and I think it was once a lot better. Arresting Loras was right up Cerseii's alley and it's just another reason for Margaery to hate her. Watching Tommen try to free him was very entertaining. He is such a naïve boy and completely whipped towards Margaery. What a man would do for his woman, huh? Onto the north, Stannis sees a lot in Jon Snow, but apparently so does Melisandre. Was I the only one who was legitimately wanting to yell at the screen to tell him to resist her? Snow also had to sign for Bolton unwillingly. It was heartbreaking to know that he had to sign that agreement knowing everything that Bolton had done to his family. I hope now that Baelish is planning for an alliance with Stannis, we get to see Sansa reunited with Jon. The Starks need some happy moments. Considering we got a heartwarming scene with Stannis and his daughter, I think they are repositioning him as a good guy on this show.The last 10 minutes of the show or so were dedicated to Tyrion and Jorah's trip to Daenerys. Glad to see that he was indeed taking him to Meereen instead of King's Landing. By the preview next week, we may be getting our first interaction between the two, EVER. The Sons of the Harpy fight at the end was done really well, and it just gave us more of a reason to need Tyrion and his wit. Dany is losing so much, and now presumably both Barristan and Grey Worm? Harsh times ahead for her. It may be awhile before we see her on the Iron Throne.+Road trips +Tommen and his immaturity +Sons of the Harpy +Snow and his honor +Baelish reveals some plans +Next week's possibilities...-Screw Melisandre! 9.5/10"

",8,True,"Jorah Mormont steals a boat to navigate with Tyrion. James and Bronn travel in a merchant ship to Dorne to rescue Myrcella. The Iron Bank is charging their loan and Cersei sends a representative of the Small Council to negotiate with the bankers. Then she has a meeting with the High Sparrow and gives an army and power to his followers to kill and destroy ""the sinners"", including Little Finger's brothel, his clients and Sir Loras, the brother of Margaery. Tommen unsuccessfully tries to release Loras to send him to the Castle of Casterly Rock. Margaery leaves him to stay with her family. Stannis Baratheon plans to head to Winterfell before the snow. Jon Snow is summoning nobles to help the Night Watch with men and supplies and he has a dilemma with the name of the Bolton family. Melisandre tries to seduce Jon Snow, but he resists to the temptation and does not break his vows. Shireen meets her father feeling bored and rejected and he tells what happened to her when she was a child. Sansa visits the tombs of her ancestral and Little Finger tells a story of her family to her and tells that he will meet Cersei. Further, he tells that the best men can be manipulated and he is the master of manipulation. James and Bronn are found by a patrol and need to fight to survive. Ellaria Sand wants war but she is warned that James Lannister and Bronn are in her lands. Daenerys has a meeting with Barristan and then she does not accept the traditional games. The Sons of Harpy promote a slaughter and trap Daenerys' army.""Sons of Harpy' is one of the most brutal episodes of ""Game of Thrones"". The segments are very violent, beginning with the fanatic followers of the High Sparrow and ending with the Sons of Harpy. In-between, Castle Black is preparing for war and Ellaria wants to begin a war. The beautiful part is Stannis Baratheon having a conversation with his daughter. The preparation of Sansa by her manipulative mentor is the impressive Machiavellian part of the show. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Sons of Harpy"""
58," Full of Surprises
",10,True,"Now this episode is really epic. The ending is extraordinary.Even if you read the books, this episode is different. Jaimie and Bronn are heading toward Dorne, where they encounter some trouble. Melisandre goes to Jon Snow, the lord commander, but he stays loyal to his oath and his first love, Ygritte. In Meeren, Dany is having some trouble while ruling, and remember, conquering is not ruling. The Sons Of Harpy appear from where they are hiding, and eventually kill some of Dany's Unsullied. Unfortunately, the episode ends in a major cliffhanger where Grey Worm and Ser Barristian Selmy's fate is unknown. Believe me, I feel season 5 is going to top all seasons and things are turning intense as this season progresses."
59," The action gets kicked up a notch
",9,True,"This episode sees Cersei move to weaken House Tyrell; first she dispatches Mace Tyrell, her Master of Coin, to negotiate with the Iron Bank in Braavos then she arms the High Sparrow's fanatical followers, reforming the ancient Faith Militant, who set about killing or imprisoning anybody they consider degenerate; including Loras Tyrell; the brother of the new queen. Margaery implores her husband to have him released but he is weak when it comes to confronting High Sparrow's followers. In the North Melisandre attempts to seduce Jon Snow and Sansa learns that her protector Lord Baelish is going to leave her in Winterfell while he returns to the capital. In the South Jaime Lannister and Bronn reach Dorne and soon come into conflict with local soldiers.Across the Narrow Sea in Essos Tyrion learns that his captor is Jorah Mormont and that he is taking him to Queen Daenerys not Cersei; something that comes as a relief. Meanwhile in Meereen Daenerys is still having problems; people are still petitioning her to reopen the fighting pits and even more worryingly the Sons of the Harpy are rising in force to attack those loyal to Daenerys, including her army of unsullied.The opening three episodes only featured a limited amount of action but here there are multiple scenes of violent action; the Faith Militant's attacks in King's Landing, Jaime and Bronn fighting a quartet of Dornish troops and finally the fight between large numbers of the Sons of the Harpy and several Unsullied. These action scenes were impressively filmed and rather exciting. Away from the fighting there was the usual scheming; most notably Cersei's moves against the Tyrells which shows Margaery that her power, through her husband, isn't what she thought. As expected the cast do I fine job; I particularly enjoyed some of the quieter scenes such as those between Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau and Jerome Flynn as Jaime and Bronn; Peter Dinklage and Iain Glen as Tyrion and Jorah Mormont; Sophie Turner and Aidan Gillen as Sansa and Lord Baelish and Kit Harington and Carice van Houten as Jon Snow and Melisandre these could be seen as relatively minor parts compared to the action and more obvious scheming but they were still enjoyable. Overall I'd say this was a really good episode; certainly the most exciting of the season so far."
60," Review of season 5: Episodes 3-4
",9,True,"Greetings from Lithuania.So we are almost in the middle of season 5, and last two episodes were better that first two in my opinion. I would rate both of them 9. First off all both of them were longer in running time - that's a good thing. There were also more action, although action is just one of the parts (and not the most important) which makes this show great. Plot is moving to interesting directions, and while there some stops here and there, overall i'm intrigued.Overall, episodes 3 and 4 were superior then first two. Bigger, bloodier, more intriguing. At this point we are still far from end of season 5, but something tels (no i haven't read books, so i'm fresh here) me that this season is going to be more of buildup for future events. I kinda had this idea first when they announced directors for season 5 and there weren't ""heavyweighter"" from previous seasons. Sure, there will be meaningful events, but so far everything is moving not very fast and more on a buildup level. Still, this is a great show so far no matter what direction it goes."
61," You know nothing, Jon Snow
",9,True,The storylines flow effortlessly forward and we get some nice foreshadowing - and some inconspicuous insight into an important backstory.
62," Colors across kingdoms, all wielding the same bloody sword
",9,True,"While the young king decides not to resort to violence, it seems that he is alone in this sentiment. Everyone practically bleeds or suffers some sort of unfortunate fate today. Cersei has armed a militant based on faith, it's a very arbitrary group as it incarcerates anyone who is seen disruptive, but the category is wide and ambiguous. The pretext works however, as the new established militant serves her goal and vexes Margeary, which in turns create a rift on the royal newlywed's relationship.Meanwhile at North, both Stark siblings find themselves in contradicting side although they might not know the whereabouts of the other. Jon Snow is still wanted by the advancing army of Stannis, one must praise his honor as he deflects another charming offer. In a more heartwarming scene of his entire campaign, Stannis showcases his affection towards her daughter. This is probably the best performance by the father-daughter actors to date.Remarkably, the North is the only segment which doesn't draw any blood. Jamie finally reaches the land of his captured niece, he's in full redemption mode, a tad sorrowful for this season. Chemistry between him and Bronn is witty and entertaining. Bronn is smarter than he'd like to show and Jaime requires his companionship, perhaps more for a trusty friend than a hired thug, although the swordsmanship proves to be useful either way.The south has intriguing culture, aside for their elegant in handling spear, apparently they also have all female squad which has high tolerance to violence. The theme of militant is as thick as the blood they spill in this episode. Sons of Harpy deliver another more lethal blow and this time they do so openly. It ends on a high note as one of the more visceral action sequences wraps up the episode.This marks one of the bloodiest showing in the series. It'd take time to dress the wound of many characters and clean the stain from many walls."

""Sons of the Harpy"" manages to be even better than them, while not one of my favourite 'Game of Thrones' episodes or one of the show's magnum opuses, it was with this episode where Season 5 started to properly settle. While there is evidence of the quieter and intricate tone seen in the previous three episodes, ""Sons of the Harpy"" balances that and brilliantly with brutally bold action, insightful characterisation and development (the one possible exception being Sansa, who the episode could have done more with), surprising twists and revelations and drama that feels intense and emotional. Of the four episodes, it is with ""Sons of the Harpy"" where it felt the most like the storytelling and characterisation were evolving and moving forward.'Game of Thrones' has never failed to deliver on the acting. ""Sons of the Harpy"" doesn't disappoint in that regard with strong performances across the board, regardless of any reservations with Sansa it to me doesn't lie with Sophie Turner but merely that the character pales in comparison to stronger characters that have had more development and exposure.Visually, ""Sons of the Harpy"" looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'.

64," Another solid episode despite going even more slower
",8,True,"Sons of the Harpy is another solid that delivered what it promised. The performances are still great, the sets and costumes are still lavish, the music score is still beautiful, the directing remains a bit atmospheric, the editing is still nice, the characters and relationships still shine, and the script is still well-written. My only quibbles is that the pacing felt even more slower and the plot progression hasn't been advanced even further. Despite those flaws, however, it's still a good episode and I hope everything would turn out fine in the next few episodes. So, overall, not great, but still solid. :)"
65," Worst Episode of Game of Thrones Yet
",2,False,My wife and I were so disappointed last night with this episode.3 Reasons - Warning Spoilers ahead 1. The story went absolutely nowhere. With only 10 episodes a season we can't afford this.2. The scene introducing the Sand Sisters was cheesy and poorly acted. Looked like a scene from a cheap SciFi show.3. The fight scenes were just terrible! Lanister stopped a sword with his gold hand- no one saw that coming. And the final fight scene with the Sons of the Harpy was a joke of choreagraphy. It could have been an amazing way to show the Unsullied vs a decent foe but instead it was a bunch of Harpies getting behind them to slit their throtes- come on you can come up with something more imaginative than that.4. The fact that he head sparrow so easily is manipulated by the queen is sad. And the Sparrow club bearing fighters were pretty lame as well.I LOVE GoT so much- that's why I took the time out of my day to write this. Hopefully it will be a drop in the bucket towards convincing HBO to either invest real time and money into the fight scenes or fire the director of this mess.

Firstly .. its the ""king"" of seven kingdoms and the event's taking place at medieval time with dragons for gods shake! .. get a clue ... a king doesn't just visit no bodies, .. a king summons them, it just doesn't go with the storyline at all.And there is more ... king actually gets blocked by dudes wearing nothing but black robes (no armor or anything) and even if they had armors & weapons ... its within the freaking caste .. that's just totally wrong and the king had the ""kings guard"" right behind .. doing rather .. nothing, they act like first time soldiers with no clue, acting like total newbies ... kings guard are veteran soldiers(normally) and even if not(highly unlikely) they should be able to handle a few newbie monks! this is just absurd.Of course I like this show and I think everyone understands mistakes are bound to happen and silly stuff to drag stories is rather typical and people are used to that but this is just stupid really, seriously disappointed with this episode ... come on guys make some efforts at least !"

69," Best episode of the season yet
",8,True,"SONS OF THE HARPY is the best episode of the season yet, finishing as it does on a hugely impressive battle climax in which the titular characters rise up for the first time. Of course, this would be superceded by even bigger and more impressive events later on in the show, but it's good enough for now. The material in the North remains immersive, from the Boltons and their machinations to Jon's new-found responsibilities. Dorne features again but the camaraderie works for now."
70," Another Regular Episode but more brutal.
",8,True,"High Sparrow taking the City, Sons of the Harpy become more powerful. pointless Dorne story & Jaime's mission."

Dany lets her emotions get the best of her, being corrupted, for the time being, by her own ego. John has gone to get reinforcements from the Wildings to attack the Boltons. Things are all gray at the moment with everything in the offing. Most of the characters are faced with the problem of how to rule in a world so divided. Should they put it all out there and conquer, knowing that this keeps the undercurrents alive. One factor that is going to be a big time issue is the threat of the dragons which are at times pretty unpredictable. Also, with Sansa, is her marriage going to be honored in any way.

",8,True,"That was a classic episode with the one sided fight at the start, the lovely tall elegant Sansa Stark scene in the middle (God to think she has to hook up with you know who) and the internecine fight at the end with the tolling bell to great effect. It was brilliant. I watched this series at the start, got a bit browned off with the some of gratuitous sex scenes and the demise of so many of the Starks and the burgeoning careers of the Lanisters, so I failed to watch some of the middle series episodes. Now look at Jaime Lannister he's semi reformed character. I thought it was predictable but now I find this fifth season to be a return to form!"
75," I like the way we're getting to see a more admirable side of Stannis.
",8,True,"The final battle scene is worth the price of admission, and the Sand Snakes looks as lethal as advertised, but I'm getting awfully tired of Stannis & Co. trying to convince Jon to muster the Night's Watch to march on Winterfell."
76," The rise of two Snows
",8,True,"The North sees a lot of movement this episode. Both warring parties have their own contradicting internal turmoil. Jon Snow opts for political merging and compromise while Ramsay uses his newly found power to oppress. The relationships between Jon Snow and the Wildlings are precarious, though it's probably the most peaceful one to achieve reconciliation. While some challenges persist, Jon pursues the best way for both groups to prolong their life expectancy against the unworldly threat.Iwan Rheon as Ramsay is a fitting antagonist. He displays a convincing euphoric reaction when people bow to his will. Unlike many other characters with cloak and dagger, Ramsay is more openly on his perverse achievements. Theon Greyjoy is truly a lost cause, the show invested a whole season on breaking him with mind games and castration, this is a fate worse than half of the deaths.It's been awfully strange, mainly because the overwhelming discomfort, when Theon is paraded in front of Sansa. The two have not been close, this time they find themselves as captives though their circumstances may be different. As usual there are increasing amount of people who might just soil the budding flower persona of Sansa, but it seems that she's not as alone as she thinks.The last act of the episode is a visual eye candy as Tyrion and Jorah Mormont have leisure sail over the mythical haunted land. This set piece is strikingly beautiful, worthy of any fantasy tale. These two characters are a unique pair, they are nothing alike in term of personality yet they must endure each other and any outside threat the elegant vista might hide.Some men are luckily absolved and granted more than life, while the rest might be tragically doomed."
77," Good plot development as the season reaches its midpoint
",9,True,"The previous episode left us wondering about the fate of Ser Barristan Selmy and Grey Worm; here we learn that the former has died and the latter was seriously wounded. Daenerys decides that she must take action and has the leaders of the city's richest families arrested and brought to her. She takes them to her dragons who kill and eat one of them; she warns that the same may happen to one of the others the next day but ultimately decides on a different strategy after a talk with Missandei. Elsewhere in Essos Tyrion and Jorah Mormont reach the ancient, abandoned city of Valyria where they see the third of Daenerys's dragons and are attacked by a group of Stone Men.Back in Westeros Jon frees the Wildling Tormund Giantsbane and agrees on a plan to get the Free People north of the wall to help in the coming war in exchange for land south of the wall. Meanwhile Stannis prepares to head south in an attempt to liberate Winterfell. At Winterfell Sansa meets Theon for the first time since she left for the capital with her father in Season One. She is also told that she has friends who are looking out for her.This was another fine episode with some solid plot advancement. Daenerys's story moved along nicely; showing both her hard side and a more conciliatory side. The way her dragons burnt and ate one of her prisoners was impressive; one could almost believe that dragons were real. The scenes featuring Peter Dinklage and Iain Glen as Tyrion and Jorah Mormont were a delight with some enjoyably dialogue, spectacular scenery and a dramatic struggle against the Stone Men. It was great to finally see the Stone Men after they have been mentioned many times in relation to what will happen to those suffering from grey-scale. The events in Winterfell were tense; one never knows if Iwan Rheon's Ramsey Bolton is going to do something horrible; any time he is on screen there is a feeling that something bad could happen at any moment. The scene where he torments Theon in front of his father and Sansa was particularly uncomfortable. The scenes at Castle Black may not have been as tense but they were still interesting; Jon's mission to recruit Wildlings and Stannis setting off towards Winterfell both promise interesting events to come. Overall another really good episode even though many major characters did not feature."
78," Interesting developments
",8,True,"A low-key episode all in all, but that doesn't mean to say that it didn't make an impression. Even in the quietest episodes, lots happen, and with characters making bold decisions, it seems that Season 5 is definitely in full swing. Funnily enough though, this is only the fourth episode ever not to feature King's Landing as one of its prime locations, the first, second and third being, the Kingsroad, the Rains of Castamere and the Watchers on the Wall. This just shows that we don't need the tensions in the capital city to make an episode enthralling.In the north, there were a number of great scenes. Most notably was Jon's conversation with Tormund. To free a man who once had so much hatred for Jon is quite a bold thing to do, and just shows that he is a superb Lord Commander, who is able to make those difficult decisions, to the detriment of consolidating a friendship with his fellow watchmen. He evidently did heed the Maester's words, which seemed to have changed Jon for the better. In addition, we got hear a bit more about the winter that's coming. Both Jon and Stannis are of the mind that the protection in the north is of paramount importance; Jon calling on Tormund to round up the Wildlings and Stannis calling on Samwell to understand a bit more about Dragonglass. This was a great way to get us excited about what is to come, because it's inevitable at this point that it will.In Winterfell, things are going nicely. I've never read the books so I cannot compare the plot developments, but the television adaption appeals to me. Sansa's discretion is the only thing that's saving her at the moment, but it's nice to see that she still got friends. But we also have the frightening Ramsay, played wonderfully by Iwan Rheon, attempting to transcend himself, much to Roose's dismay. His retelling of how Ramsay was born, however, was a definite character change, as we see Ramsay consider his own mortality. As a prediction (and I'm probably wrong), I have a feeling Myranda will have a greater role in future episodes, and will eventually attempt to kill Sansa, no matter the cost.In Meereen, Ser Barristan's death has been confirmed, but Grey Worm has survived! Currently at a loss of two advisers, Daenerys makes a rash decision to threaten the masters, in the hope of gaining their backing - but it's a snap decision that she regrets later. Thankfully, as a character who learns from hers and other's mistakes, Daenerys looks to the council of those around her, including Missandei, and she finally decides to open the fighting pits, and as a show of trust, marry Hizdahr zo Loraq. A surprising turn of events, but one that I can understand fully considering her circumstances. If she wants peace, she can only give the people what they want. Missandei's scene with Grey Worm was lovely too, with the Unsullied warrior confessing a crime that many people can admit to - it just shows how humane this series is.Finally in the south seas of Essos, now crossing through Valyria, Tyrion continues to talk aimlessly to Jorah Mormont, trying to free himself, to no avail. But things get really interesting when they pass through the ""doomed city"". Credit to the visual effects team, this was a sight to behold and more - and the final shot with Drogon flying overhead was purely magical. There was something really nostalgic about that poem the two men shared too, as it helps to expand the universe of Game of Thrones even further. The unexpected arrival of the Stone Men was certainly surprising, and I was anxious for neither character to be infected. But, as always in Game of Thrones, there are ultimate consequences, and just like the real world, nothing is fair, and nowhere is safe. Jorah's mortality is now in question.A suitably strong installment for the series, not as exciting as last week's, but definitely worthy of praise. Bryan Cogman has made some excellent contributions in the past, probably best known for the Laws of Gods and Men. Let's see if he can continue this trend for next week!8.3/10"
79," Will the Boy Be Killed?
",9,True,"The focus begins with Dany, whose miscalculations and ego have caused great distress. She begins by trying to rule through fear. She brings in the city's family leaders. She feeds one of them to the dragons, a horror filled scene. We don't know at this point if the carnage will continue, or if she is making a point. At first it appears to be the former. Things change however. The most interesting story takes us back to Theon and Ramsey, the utter psychotic ""possible"" son. He is totally evil, embracing the fear of everyone. He is also a coward because he has only accomplished things through his being shielded by his power base. He abuses women and plays psychological games with Sansa. He knows that she is vulnerable. She has grown some and believes that Littlefinger will do something to help her, but we will see how much this trust is worth. The forces under John Snow and his people amass and head out to face the Boltons. In a nice hook, we have Jorah hoping to appease the Dragon Lady with Tyrion. Unfortunately, they are accosted by the people who have become savages because of greyscale. The concluding scene sets up an interesting road ahead."
80," Another slow episode, but still solid
",8,True,"Kill the Boy isn't as excellent as I hoped much like the previous episode, but it's still solid. Yes, the plot progression is still too slow and hasn't been advanced further and not to mention the new characters haven't been given anything to do. Despite those issues, however, everything still turned out fine.The performances are still good, the script, despite how the slow the plot has been so far, is still well-written, the music score is still great, the scenery is still gorgeous, the sets and costumes are still nice, the directing is crisp, and the editing is smooth. So, overall, another solid episode in spite of it's slow pacing. :)"
81," The high standard hasn't been killed
",8,True,"Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.Season 5 was a very well done one, but of the five seasons up to this point of 'Game of Thrones' it for me took the longest to completely settle. All the previous Season 5 episodes were very good to great, especially ""Sons of the Harpy"" (the biggest, boldest and most brutal), but it was that episode that felt the most settled. This is continued with the halfway point episode ""Kill the Boy"".""Kill the Boy"" is not as big, as bold, as violent, as surprising or as crisp, but it's far from dull and never less than interesting even with the slower pace and more intimate atmosphere. Do wish that the newer characters had more to do and that there was more to Sansa's character. Having said that, there is a good amount of insightful character development still, compelling drama and very promising story progression, it actually does feel like things are moving forward.'Game of Thrones' has never failed to deliver on the acting. ""Kill the Boy"" doesn't disappoint in that regard with strong performances across the board, old and new. There are no exceptions, even with the least interesting characters.Visually, ""Kill the Boy"" looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. The visual effects are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about ""Kill the Boy"" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is once again. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions. The story is still riveting, with plenty of passion and sensitivity.To conclude, very good episode but 'Game of Thrones' have done better. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
82," Taking Decisions
",8,True,"In Meereen, Grey Worm is wounded and Barristan is dead. Daenerys decides to arrest the leaders of the wealthy families and gives one of them to feed her dragons. Jon Snow proposes a deal to Tormund to move the Wildlings south of the Wall and join forces with the Night Watch, and a great number of his men do not accept the truce. Stannis and his army head to the North to fight against the Bolton. Brienne sends a message to Sansa in case she is in danger, and she has a strange meeting with Theon. Daenerys review her position and decides to open the arenas again to keep the tradition of people in Meereen. Mormont and Tyrion stumble with a dragon first and then with the Stone Men in Valerya city. They have to fight, their boat sink and Mormont is infected.""Kill the Boy"" is an interesting episode with the development of situations and characters taking decisions. The intention of Lord Commander Jon Snow to make an alliance with the Wildlings will certainly bring consequences. Daenerys new decisions about people of Meereen will be right or wrong? The encounter of Sansa and Theon is cruel. Mormont is infected and is difficult to foresee his fate. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Kill the Boy"""
83," Best mid season game of thrones show yet.
",10,True,"From start to finish this one has it all. Certainly not the best episode ever. But the best episode 5, out of all 5 seasons. Great drama, action and some twits that are well pulled off, even though we could see them coming this time around. The bar is raising since episode 4. Can't wait to see the rest!The execution at the beginning was a great start to the show. The points of drama with Lady Stanza, and John Snow's story were never lagging The final scene with the attacking stone men. Now may have left us to a sort of new doomed relationship possibly?May of not been the most surprising, darkest or violent episode. But still worthy of a perfect score."
84," Still solid television, but weak Game of Thrones
",7,False,"The opening four episodes of this season of Game of Thrones felt different to the first four years of the show. The writing was slower, opting for a rather lengthy build up feel. The character motives were more political, characters like Jon and Daenerys being given material a far cry from anything they'd had before. Coincidentally, these were the only episodes sent out to critics before they aired for initial reviews, ultimately leaking online soon after. This led to my speculation that Kill the Boy would be the episode where the show's fifth season halted the build up and went truly haywire. Much to my prediction, the build up did in fact stop here. But so did the narrative. It's difficult to come out of episode five with a sense of accomplishment; Kill the Boy may go down as the slowest and most conceptually bland episode the show has ever put out.Thankfully, it's still compelling television. Game of Thrones would have to go seriously downhill for it to put out an actively weak episode; most 'dud' episodes tend to just be poorer in comparison to the show's extraordinary standard. Kill the Boy is still packed with the visual flare viewers love about the show; the scenic CGI as Stannis' army marched away from Winterfell was stunning, and our eventual insight into Valeria demonstrated the show's knack for breathtaking photography. There was also some nicely symbolic moments in episode five, namely Daenerys' plan to marry Hizdahr zo Loraq. Dany is a character who began the show being forced into a marriage against her will, so it's an interesting development that she is now willing to use the concept of marriage for her own political gain. I also particularly enjoyed Stannis and Sam's brief sequence for a number of reasons. On paper they make an interesting pairing, but when you add the fact that Sam himself killed a White Walker, Stannis feels less important in comparison. This kind of thoughtful character work is what just about saved this episode from falling flat on every level.Those familiar with Game of Thrones understand its ability to cut between five or six, sometimes even seven or eight locations per episode. Kill the Boy is content with just three, which is a risky move. When the show resorts to just one location per episode, like in season two's Blackwater (my personal favourite episode of the show), the scale is increased in order to sustain it. Besides season four's Wall-focused battle episode, I think I'm correct in stating that Kill the Boy is the first episode to entirely remove King's Landing from the equation. And the episode suffers for it. There isn't enough variety to keep the show compelling; we lost the progress of Arya's efforts in Braavos, and we lacked the interesting political happenings of Cersei and Margaery. By resorting simply to the North, the Wall and the general surroundings of Meereen, episode five feels almost bland compared to the rest of this season.The highlight of Kill the Boy is undoubtedly Iwan Rheon's performance as Ramsay Snow, I mean, Bolton, who makes for the most compelling dinner sequence the show's offered since Arya served for Tywin (aw, remember him?) back in season two. Rheon conducts this sequence with a horrifying glint in his eye that suggests Ramsay is well on his way to being one of the most interesting villains the show has right now. Unfortunately this was followed by a seemingly misplaced sequence between him and his father, in which the episode comes to a complete halt. It's the kind of narrative mistake one would expect from a small scale ITV drama, not from one of the most critically acclaimed fantasy shows the world has ever seen. Up until now, season five had been slow, but admirably so. Kill the Boy fails to both continue strengthening the build up or advance the story in interesting ways. We're midway through this season now, and time is running thin for the writers to craft a satisfying conclusion to the countless arcs they set up in the first four episodes."
85," You are my son
",8,True,"More of a story building episode focused mainly on the happenings in the north and Essos. In Mereen : Barristan Selmy is dead and Grey worm in seriously injured (10 minutes of cliché romance with Melissanda). Danerys council has grown small prompting her to capture leaders of the wise masters and using some scary dragon eating torture techniques. Advised by Melisande, she decides to go for a more political route choosing to betroth Hizdar and opening the fighting pits. All in all things are not really looking up for Danerys as she feels increasingly alone and has started to show signs of a true TargaryanAt the wall:Two important decisions taken. Stannis decides to move towards Winterfell and Jon is going with Tormund to bring the wild-lings south of the wall and protect them from the white walkers. Some side story aside on dragon glass and Sam. Occupies major part and the tag line of the episodeAt Winterfell: Ramsay is already starting his mental games with Sansa as he introduces Theon as reek and asks him to give the bride on their wedding. Roose Bolton announces the pregnancy of Walda Frey and which in turn leads to my favorite scene in the episode. As Ramsay discusses his future with Roose Bolton in lieu of this, Roose tells him about his mother who he raped on her wedding night beneath the hanging corpse of her husband. In the end, he saved Ramsay because he was his son. The dialog is delivered with amazing effect and enforces Roose Bolton as another of those awesome Grey characters like Tywin & Stannis.Tyrion: Jorah and Tyrion take a shortcut through the ruins of Valaryia and get attacked by stone men. Jorah get infected with grey-scale while saving Tyrion. This is the most eye catching part of the episode in terms of exploring a new location. The ancient ruins of Valaryia look fabulous and you can really feel yourself in the lost city. A brief sighting of Drogon adds flavor to this well shot scene making it one of the best scenic shots in the entire season so far.The episode is worth watching mainly for the machinations of Roose Bolton and catching a glimpse of ValayriaCheers"
86," Kill the boy Jon, Kill the boy!!!
",9,True,"Holy crap, This is thee best episode in whole season, and one of the best in the whole series. This season was really slow but man this episode was something else, Game of Thrones has done it again. all the stories were Great in this episode. You have Theon finally meeting Sansa Finally some Dragon action Jon deciding to go beyond the wall Jorah and Tyrion fighting for their lives Dany making a huge decision No Cersei/Tommen/Margaery Bullsh!tand the build up for the Stannis/Boltons War has started. i was really giving up on this season but this episode brought it all, and it's only gonna get better from here. P.S. i never write reviews, i only wrote this because the other reviews are crap, Have a nice day."
87," Let the Man Be Born
",7,False,"Halfway through the season, things are starting to be put into place for Game of Thrones. I can't say this was an overly entertaining episode, but it served as a set up as for what's to come in the final 5 episodes. I know some people have been complaining about how slow this year has felt. I haven't seen it that way, I think we have gotten some of the best character drama and new interactions this year. Unfortunately, although good, I think this week was probably the worst of the season.The promo showed Tyrion seeing dragons for the first time and I just assumed they would be closing in on Meereen. But I forgot that one of Dany's dragons had left her for the time being. So no, Tyrion and Daenerys don't meet in the episode, but we did get some dragon action. Coming off of last week's troubles with Hizdahr, Dany was forced to make another difficult decision with Barristan dead and Grey Worm seriously wounded. In typical Daenerys form, she decides to feed one of his men to her dragons, and debated giving Hizdahr to them. After a few talks with Missandei, she decides against killing him and instead forms an alliance and agreement. But apparently wants a husband in the process. I do wonder what this means for Naharis. Meanwhile, on the way to Meereen, Tyrion and Jorah ran into a few Stone Men. Of course, we had to believe that even if they had beaten them, someone was going to be touched by the stone creatures. Jorah takes the heat there, as we will have to wait and see what kind of long term ramifications it ensues.Jon Snow had another big week. He had to make some decisions regarding the wildlings future at the wall. Releasing one of his former friends turned enemy was a cool moment for Snow. It's just great to see a character that has gone through so much like Snow, get to exhibit his power and ultimately his likability. Unfortunately it looks as though Snow will be leaving with the Wildlings to save their people, along with Stannis leaving for Winterfell. It's disappointing to see the Stannis and Snow dynamic end, but hopefully sometime down the line we will see a reunion. Speaking of Winterfell, we got a lot of Ramsay material this week, as disturbing as it is to watch him. He borderline raped his so called 'lover' and then forced an awkward dinner upon his future bride, because why the hell not, it's Ramsay and he loves to just be the biggest jerk on the show. But it did give us a great look at the improved Sansa. She's in a terrible position already but I feel like her attitude is changing and she's beginning to stand up for herself. Her face when she saw Theon and questioning Ramsay's mother showed the possible future nature of a fierce Sansa.So a lot of cool things this week but not much material to go crazy about. I do feel like it will be the last slowly paced episode as we head into the final stretch of season 5. And soon we will eventually get that legendary meeting between Tyrion and Daenerys. It seems like next week will be a much bigger and more intense episode.+New and improved Sansa +Snow continues to do likable things +Dragon action +Stannis heading to Winterfell -Stannis & Snow's dynamic ends-Pacing was slow 7.8/10"
88," Ships
",10,True,One of my favourite episodes of all time. Theon has a great role
89," The most mature episode yet
",9,True,"KILL THE BOY is a particularly fine episode and the strongest of the season thus far. The emphasis isn't on action and bloodshed but rather the majurity of the characters and the political actions they need to take and the consequences they need to face. Jon and Sansa are on particularly strong form here when facing up to their situations, with strong support from Tormund, Roose and Ramsey. Meanwhile, Daenerys is the most interesting she's been in a while. The final moments with Jorah and Tyrion remind one of what a fine actor Iain Glen is."
90," Kill the boy and let the man be born
",7,False,"The first scene begins with Maester Aemon having Sam read about Danaerys' activities and he regrets not being there for her and instead being at the Wall. Jon comes in and seeks his counsel regarding the treaty with the wildlings, to which Aemon advises him to ""kill the boy and let the man be born"" - Jon should stand by his decisions and do what needs to be done. We see the Night's Watch strongly disagreeing with Jon's proposed actions. He makes a deal with Tormund, freeing him and agreeing to personally help settle the wildlings at Hardhorne in the North. In Meereen, Ser Barristan is dead after fighting the sneaky golden masks (The Sons of the Harpy). In the books he is shown to be alive and defending Meereen at the end of A Dance with Dragons (Book 5). Killing him was a risky move but is quite realistic, as even though an exceptional fighter, being old and wearing no armor and fighting guerrilla soldiers during an ambush the chances of survival are dim. However Grey Worm survives though heavily wounded. Danaerys makes a decision to have the heads of the noble families burned alive and eaten by her two dragons. This is quite confusing as the previous episode showed Barristan advising her to not become her father, the Mad King. Then she agrees to open the fighting pits and marry Hizadahr Loraq. In the books she keeps hostages from the noble families and only marries Hizadahr after he fulfills his 90 days promise of peace in Meereen. The episodes 4 and 5's pacing is really fast but quite inconsistent. in Winterfell Brienne and Podrick stay at an inn and recruit a man serving to the Boltons to help Sansa. Speaking of Sansa, the episode was pleasantly surprising in a good way. She is looking at the broken tower where her brother fell down and became a wolf boy when Myranda, Ramsay's lover urges her to explore the kennels for a surprise. She truly is, as she sees Theon scared and broken as Reek. At the dinner table with the Boltons, Ramsay reveals his true nature and tries to torture Sansa mentally like Joffrey by making Theon/Reek apologize to her for killing her brothers and declares Theon/Reek as her best man during their upcoming wedding as he is her foster brother. Sansa and Roose see through his bullshit and he and Fat Walda declare that a legitimate Bolton junior is arriving, pissing off Ramsay. Ramsay is angry at his father for this, but Roose knows how to handle his bastard and assures him that he is his son and reveals to him the truth about his birth, and convinces him to be ready and fight Stannis, who finally leaves the Wall with his family, Ser Davos, Melisandre and his army to fight at Winterfell. That aside, Jorah and Tyrion travel through Valyria, the Targaryen ancestral nation which is in ruins. Tryion and Jorah recite poetry and their pairing looks great (like Bronn and Tyrion with Jorah as the more serious and honorable version of Bronn). They witness a dragon flying (was it Drogon?) and are attacked by Stone men, the crazy greyscale infected who reside in the ruins of Valyria and Tyrion jumps in the water to avoid being touched and infected by them. We see him alive later with Jorah all soaking wet having rescued him but become infected himself (in the books it is Jon Connington who was Rhaegar's bestie who rescues Tyrion and is starting to become a stone man). Poor Jorah; from Lord Friendzone to Lord Stone Man...To recap:+ ""Kill the Boy"" speech by Maester Aemon. + The rise of the Northern Bastards: Jon Snow's treaty with Tormund and Ramsay now preparing for a fight with Stannis. + Dark Sansa who stands to Ramsay and his family. + Brienne still determined to protect Sansa. + Grey Worm and Melisandre's romance. + Jorah suffering from greyscale and its potential future impact.RIP Ser Barristan the Bold. - Inconsistent Danaerys."

92," Not Good
",1,False,"This episode has got to be a perfect proof of the deteriorating quality of Game of Thrones episodes lately. Why do I say that? Well, let's just start with how Dorne's story is unfolding. In the last few episodes, we see Oberyn's lover plotting with his daughters for revenge against the Lannisters. Knowing that it would culminate into a full blown confrontation between the duo from King's Landing and the Sand Snakes, we were hoping for an exhilarating fight to say the least and some irrevocable damage that was to be inflicted on the possibility of peace between the two clans (exemplified by Myrcella's scar in the book). Instead, what we got was some really badly orchestrated fight between the two factions and an absolutely anti-climatic end to all of the plotting. What was the whole point of this? It seems like the writers had only intended to drag the story on. Moving on to Winterfell, Sansa got ready for her big night and ends up out-witting a lowly servant girl in her attempts to unnerve her. Are we supposed to rejoice? Is this a victory? Is this the moment when Sansa finds her footing? That this scene would be the answer to these questions would be belittling the question itself. Sansa STARK would never have problems out- witting servants. Her problems have been far graver and her torturers truly powerful people, confronting whom would require not wit and contempt but true power and strength. When I realized that Sansa was to be Jeyne's substitute, I knew this scene would come and from the books I do know what's in store for Sansa is worse. Now the reason why I am unhappy with this scenario is because in the books, she has time and opportunity to gain strength and truly come onto her own. But here, she has yet again been reduced to a play-thing for perverts. Since she is again helpless against her tormentors,we are left to wondering when her rescuer would come to save her (maybe Brienne, Theon or whoever, but never herself) - a truly nauseating prospect. The show writers have clearly sacrificed Sansa's character growth for some cheap horror shots. Now why did I rate this revolting episode a 2 and not a 1 or 0 (not sure if 0 is an option)? Well that would be because of a few (precisely two) moments of redemption, like Tyrion thinking on his feet and Arya's lie. I am seriously reconsidering watching the series because of the bitter aftertaste left by this episode."
93," The risks taken last night weren't merely big plot twists.
",8,True,"With all due respect to George R.R. Martin, leeway with the books has made Game of Thrones Season 5 the most consequential yet, and ""Kill the Boy"" set yet another strong precedent."

",8,True,"This episode gives me a slight intermission vibe - but it's a quite entertaining intermission, so that's fine with me."
95," Another regular episode with some pointless scene.
",8,True,This Episode show us a lot of alliance & new relationships between characters. and it contained with a lot of pointless scene. at least this episode continue the story. with a one big death in the end.

",9,True,"Well if this was the worst GoT had to offer before season 7 then damn, just goes to show how high the quality is for this show! I come back to this episode after the travesty of season 8 with a new found appreciation. Even this episode, with the stupid Dorne plot and slow pacing, is better than anything we've had in the last season."
97," Long
",10,True,I like the bit where they talked about the size of a dwarf Willy
98," Cheesy!
",8,True,"Well, it was definitely one of the weakest episodes of Game of Thrones.The Arya's part was nicely visualized but was not interesting as far as written content goes, the story of that part is becoming quite boring and at times one asks what the hell is going on and why? A prefect example of excessive mystery and low content which leads to irritation.The kings landing is still good, littlefinger is acting extra smart with his artifice and Cersei still believes she is extra smart. The faith part is fine as well.The Tyrion part was a bit weird in the humor area. The Dorne part was unpleasant as far as fight sequence and acting of the sand snakes go, the dialogues were made even cheesier when delivered by the sand snakes. I wish they had taken in the right actresses and good choreographers or focused on other good characters left. They could have focused on Euron Greyjoy, casted Timothy Gibbs perhaps.As far as Sansa part goes, one should know that violence is a part of the world which game of thrones encompasses and men or women, no one is immune to it, many characters have suffered a gruesome fate.Those who have seen the episodes sincerely and without prejudice will never complain that only female characters suffer or have suffered in this show. I am seriously upset that fans were angry about the last scene, what Ramsay did was expected of him, he isn't a noble man and Sansa was never the most clever or strong character, in other words after Ned's death it was a character which was a subject to other's will, and most of the time it never had much power over itself due to the situations she was in.However, the thing which is becoming more and more irritatingly frequent with game of thrones is the cheap cliffhanger thing in the end which looks quite artificial. It seems like it's done just to shock in the end and frankly it looks and feels quite cheesy.I will give it 8 because when you compare it with other TV shows, it is still better and they shockingly and easily score 8 or 9 here."
99," Arya's training progresses, Sansa is married and House Tyrell has more setbacks
",9,True,After a two episode absence we get to see Arya Stark again; weeks have passed and she is still spending her time preparing the bodies of the dead and sweeping the floor. She claims to be ready to progress in her training so Jaqen H'ghar asks her to tell him who she is and who she came to be there; each time he catches her in a lie he strikes her. Another test comes when a young girl is brought to the House of Black and White; she suffers from an incurable condition and can only hope for a comfortable death; it is up to Arya to make it as easy for her as possible; telling her what she needs to hear not what is actually true. Elsewhere in Essos Tyrion and Jorah Mormont continue their journey but are captured by a group of slavers' it is only Tyrion's quick talking that saves his life and persuades their captors not to take them in the wrong direction.Back in Westeros Sansa is warned of what happens to women who bore Ramsey Bolton. Later her wedding takes place and her wedding night is anything but romantic. In the capital Lord Baelish informs Cersei that Sansa is at Winterfell and tells her that once Stannis and Lord Bolton have fought it out he will have the Knights of the Vale attack the victor on condition that Warden of the North. Later Olenna Tyrell arrives demanding the release of her son but after a brief enquiry Margaery is taken into custody as well; accused of giving false testimony. In Dorne Jaime and Bronn find Myrcella but are immediately attacked by a group of women known as the Sand Snakes.I was rather shocked to see so many one star reviews for this episode as I really enjoyed it. The opening where Arya washed the corpses may not have been exciting but there was a tenderness that made it a joy to watch. Her story progressed nicely with Maisie Williams once again putting in a fine performance. As usual Peter Dinklage does a great job as Tyrion; especially as he pleads for his life. The scenes featuring Sophie Turner as Sansa Stark were some of the most disturbing in the series; especially after her wedding when she is raped by Ramsey; he is one of the series' least pleasant characters by some way and this final scene was a gruelling watch. The goings on in King's Landing were intriguing; Lord Baelish is as conniving as ever and the treatment of the Tyrell's is sure to have repercussions later in the series. Overall another fine episode.
100," By far the weakest episode of the entire season, but still pretty good
",7,False,"When Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken aired on HBO, fans of the show and the book series hated it for being more brutal and disturbing in comparison to the previous episodes. What's worse it that it received a 58% rating on Rottentomatoes. Ouch. However, I think that this is a pretty good episode. But before I can give it some praise, there are some problems I have with it.In the previous episodes, the dialog was mostly good despite how slow the plot progression has gotten, but it's sad to say that the dialog here is really weak. It came across as too violent and disturbing particularly the ending sequence where Ramsay Bolton rapes Sansa Stark which came across as really unnecessary (which was the only reason why it received such controversy) and made me felt sorry for her. The second and third problems are the script and plot progression. The script does have some fine moments, but it lacks the spark that made the previous episodes (not to mention the previous seasons) so great. Also, the story did little to advance the story-arcs for the Lannister and Stark characters.However, despite those flaws, everything else turned out OK. The performances, despite how weak the dialog was, are still good, the scenery, sets and costumes are still gorgeous, the music score from Ramin Djawadi is still fabulous and suited the atmospheric tone in some of the scenes really well, the directing is really good, and the editing is even more sharper this time around.So, overall, Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken is by far the weakest episode of the entire season, but in spite of it's problems, it's still pretty good. :)"
101," So many complaints for the sake of complaining
",5,False,"Yep, let us talk about the ending. So many people complaining about the Sansa incident forgetting two things:1. It doesn't actually show it happen, it just very heavily implies that it does. So stop complaining about something that it doesn't actually show.2. Go back to the very first episode. Viserys sexually assaults his sister in his very first scene. THEN at the end of the episode, Drogo rapes Dany. IT ACTUALLY SHOWS THIS.The issues with the episode are it is a very boring episode with way too much time dedicated to the Arya storyline. There is NOTHING that happens at the end which even compares to incidents in earlier episodes"
102," Poorly written and directed
",4,False,"My least favorite game of Thrones episode. While some parts of this episode are okay, it is dragged down by the poor writing and directing in Dorne, in addition to the horrible shot at the end of the episode. The remaining scenes of this episode aren't enough to make it even mediocre.Mylod really performed poorly here, failing entirely to create suspension in the fight scene, nor make any of the scenes emotional or believable.Not a good episode of GoT. Possibly the worst.4/10 - Poor"
103," Underrated spoilers for season 5 and 6
",7,False,"I have the benefit of hind sight in regard to the series since I binged the whole thing before the start of season 7. Because I binged the whole show in a week there was nothing that really stood out that justified this being rated as the show's worst episode. Many people hate the episode because of dorne and sansa getting raped and gave the whole thing 1 star because of it. Lets look at each subplot of this episode to see if the 1 star ratings are justified deserved.Tyrion and Jorah: We get a great moment where tyrion and Jorah talk about Jorah's father. There is also some entertaining banter between the two of them before they are captured by slavers. We get another great moment where tyrion escapes death by talking his way out of it.Arya: Arya plays the game of faces and is forced to accept that she doesn;t hate the hound any more. The scene where she successfully lies to the girl about the poison and the reveal of the hall of faces were also very impressiveKingslanding: We see yet another example of how Littlefinger is the best player of the game. There is also a great moment between Olenna and Cersei. Finally in a shocking twist both Loras and Margaery are arrested by the faith. Cersei's Plan seems to be working perfectly. (The High Sparrow is easily the best of the new characters that were introduced this season.Winterfell: Sansa stands up for herself against Ramsay's insane girlfriend. The wedding ceremony was very well done. And now for the rape scene. Is it disturbing? Yes. Is it horrible that Sansa had to suffer even more? Yes? Did we already know how horrible Ramsay was? Yes. However, Sansa didn't know. It was perfectly in Ramsay's character to do something horrible like that and its even worse in the books. Not to mention that now Sansa realizes she can't just blindly trust Littlefinger. He threw her into a horrible situation and did't know better. Those saying that the show runners didn't care about Sansa's pain during the scene were proven wrong in Season 6 when SPOILERSansa confronts Littlefinger about what happened and describes how she can still feel what happened. The scene was done as tastefully as possible and the way Sansa described the scene in season 6 is something I've never heard before in any movie or tv show yet it also sounds very realistic. Sansa's suffering in king's landing helped her in becoming less naive in regards to princes and queens while her suffering in winterfell helped her become less naive about Littlefinger. This episode also starts Reek/Theon on a path to redemption. Dorne: Yeah okay this was really bad. The sand snakes are horrible characters and the fight choreography and editing was terrible. To this date this was the worst action scene in the showIn conclusion, 4 of 5 story lines were great while 1 wasn't which equals 8 out of 10 stars. Even if I thought the winterfell plot was bad this episode that would be 6 or 7 stars. The worst episode of the show is not Unbowed Unbent Unbroken, it's season 7 episode 6 Beyond the Wall"
104," Best episode of the season (so far)
",10,True,"After reading some very negative reviews on what can surely only be called the greatest episode of the season so far, I feel compelled to write my own review to demonstrate what makes this episode stand out to me.First of all, last week's episode was fairly uneventful, therefore when this week's episode aired it should have been unanimously praised. However, many viewers are claiming that this episode was ""one of the worst episodes of GOT"", ""poorly done"", and ""terrible"" - did we watch the same episode?!Okay, sure: the fight scene between the Sand Snakes and Jaime and Bronn seemed clumsy as certainly someone should have died (*cough cough* the one-handed-Jaime *cough cough*), yet I was sitting on the edge of my seat fearing for the loss of any of the characters as I want to see them all survive (despite the fact that inevitably they cannot all possibly), therefore when the fight was intervened I let out a sigh of relief knowing that everyone was safe - for the time being.But what annoys me the most is the fact that it is the final scene which people are condemning and berating the writers for. This is absolutely ludicrous. Yes, Sansa has been through hell from the beginning, and as of recent she has been beginning to gain some authority and power so to see it all wiped away in this rape scene is tragic. But is it really that hard to fathom? We're talking about Ramsay Snow (or Bolton - whatever): the most sickening, evil cretin of a human being in all of Westeros. We have witnessed him viciously mutilating people in the past - indeed, a victim happens to be in the same room as them! - so is it really that horrific that he did as he has always done to Sansa? No! Of course it's not! It is entirely logical and whilst it is upsetting to see Sansa, a character we want to see succeed after having gone through so much, being raped, it is the only thing that would have made sense in this scene. And looking to the future, we can only yearn for the day that Ramsay gets what's coming to him. Whether that be by the hand of Brienne, Stannis, Sansa herself, or perhaps even Theon (unlikely, I believe), it will be a fine episode to look forward to.In addition, do remember that in the very first season Daenerys was brutally raped by Khal Drogo and in that scene they showed far more than they did in Sansa's scene in this episode - so why is this episode being criticised so much more?This episode was stellar: Arya begins making some serious progress in the House of Black and White and we learn what all the bodies are cleaned for; Tyrion and Jorah are captured by pirates; Littlefinger swears loyalty to the King and perhaps sets up some serious chaos for future episodes; the Sand Snakes and Jaime and Bronn all close in on Myrcella; Lady Olenna and Queen-Mother Cersei have their polite conversation of (un)veiled threats; Margaery and Loras are arrested as King Tommen sits helplessly and watches in horror; and Ramsay and Sansa begin their wretched relationship together. If last week's episode was lacking, then this week's episode was a gift and should be unanimously praised. This was by far the most action-packed, thrilling and exciting episode of the season, yet it was also the most emotionally manipulative. For that, this is my favourite episode of season 5 thus far. I do sincerely hope the rest of the season delivers and continues with the momentum of this episode."
105," ""A girl is not ready to become no one. But she is ready to become someone else""
",8,True,"This episode finally establishes that while many characters follow the storyline from the books although with slight changes (due to TV as a medium), others have completely different story lines. Waiting eagerly for the next episode.Arya continues her training at the House of Black and White as she fails again at her test, but then later learns to lie successfully and kill someone without being emotional, passing the first of her many trials and is introduced to the collection of dead faces in the basement. Readers know what her future holds. Viewers, wait for a surprise.Meanwhile Jorah and Tyrion roam around and talk (Tyrion does, until Jorah tells him to shut up). Their chemistry is superb, not unlike Tyrion and Bronn. The conversation changes to fathers, and Tyrion tells Jorah the reason he is here and accidentally reveals to Jorah that his father died while leading an expedition beyond the Wall due to mutiny. Jorah gets emotional. They are captured by slavers and Tyrion uses his wit and loud mouth to save his cock from being cut off and sold to a cock merchant and convinces them to let Jorah fight in the pits in Meereen which Danaerys has reopened. We know Jorah is going to kick ass based to the released Season 5 photos. Talk about luck...... Speaking of Bronn, we are treated to his wonderful rendition of ""The Dornishman's Wife"", a famous song in Westeros, as Jerome Flynn gets to flex his singing muscles again (He was the half of the hit duo Robson and Jerome in the 90s). Reaching the Water Garden Jaime urges Myrcella to leave with him, but the Sand Snakes attack and attempt to take her hostage. The fight is very clumsy - they seriously can't defeat a sell sword and a one handed man?! Also bad cinematography and editing, as the camera angles are very shaky and there are too many cuts making it difficult to see who is fighting who.Fortunately Doran Martell anticipated this and has his Captain/Head of Security Areo Hotah stop the fight and capture them and also Ellaria Sand who gave such orders to the Sand Snakes.The Sand Snakes are really... Boring. They are indistinguishable from each other and they overact a lot as angry bloodthirsty women who want to avenge their father. And they can't fight! Oberyn would've killed Jaime and Bronn within seconds (I know he died in the trial by combat but he would've killed the Mountain if he wasn't stuck on drawing out his confession).Meanwhile Petyr Baelish aka Littlefinger returns to King's Landing and is interrupted by Brother Lancel ""I'm no Lannister"" who is now a religious fanatic with a flower marking on his head and surprisingly a brunette this season (never noticed it before). Their face-off is funny with Littlefinger calling his indulgences ""entertaining"" compared to Lancel's.During the meeting with Cersei, Littlefinger pledges his support to her and reveals that Sansa Stark is alive and is about to marry Ramsay Bolton while conveniently neglecting to state that he smuggled Sansa to the Boltons. What exactly is he planning? Does he have a fetish for chaos and disorder just like the Joker from The Dark Knight? Because chaos is a ladder? Sansa...oh my dear Sansa. Why? Didn't she suffer enough with Joffrey and Cersei...The hyped up nude bath scene was nothing much but we see Sansa standing up to Myranda who tries to intimidate her as she reveals Ramsay's true nature. For a while we feel good that Sansa is all grown up...... Until it comes crashing down as Ramsay tears up Sansa's clothes and violently rapes her and makes Theon/Reek watch on their wedding night. Theon's/Reek's expressions are heartbreaking and Alfie Allen deserves an Emmy for his portrayal of such a tragic character. Sansa now needs Brienne more than ever...+ Arya continues her training. + Jerome Flynn singing. + Tyrion and Jorah still going to Meereen. + Smart Doran. + There is a profession such as ""cock merchant"" in the world of GOT.Corny and unskilled Sand Snakes. They can't fight a one handed man and a sell sword and mouth off cheesy lines. They need better writing. - WTF ending. Even if we knew that the marriage wasn't going to be a happy one. - What exactly is Littlefinger's real motive? Chaos is a ladder?"
106," One of the Weakest Episodes
",7,False,"Arya is tested by Jaqen H'ghar in the House of Black and White and he tells that she is ready to become someone else. Tyrion and Jorah have a conversation about Daenerys and Jorah's father and how he was murdered by his own men; out of the blue, they are captured by pirates and turned into slaves. Little Finger stumbles with Lancei in King's Landing and has a meeting with Cersei and he plots against Stannis Baratheon and the Bolton. Jamie and Bronn are riding in Dornes and they meet Myrcella; however they need to fight against the Sand Snakes. Lady Olenna meets with Cersei to discuss the future of Loras Tyrell. He is judged by the High Sparrow and Margaery Tyrell is involved and arrested with her brother to a formal trial. Sansa marries Ramsay Bolton and he humiliates her. ""Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken"" is one of the weakest episodes of ""Game of Thrones"". Arya used to be one of my favorite characters; however her segment in the House of Black and white is boring. Little Finger is annoying with Machiavellian schemes against everyone that is powerful making the viewer lost about his true intentions. Cersei's plots are also annoying. I did not read the book, but the last scene with the humiliation of Sansa by Ramsay seems to be totally unnecessary. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken"""
107," Great
",9,True,"This episode was definitely one of the best of this season and i have no quarrel with it as other people do. This isn't exactly a review but just a comment on how other people have taken to this episode. They say that this episode was too much and they went too far. Well that is a load of rubbish this episode was excellently played out and had some strong points especially towards the end. These people feel that the ending was disturbing but I ask them if they have been watching the same game of thrones that I have because that wasn't anything out of the ordinary. Sure it was scary and horrifying but well in bounds of what is acceptable. For gods sake there was incest in the first episode and a head exploding in season 4. Also Danerys was also raped and it was probably worse but there were no complaints, so I ask if these people are really old enough to watch this show, I mean it is rated over 18."
108," Superb Storytelling
",10,True,"This episode is near the top of my list. We have several issues in motion. The biggest fact is that there is no invulnerability among any characters. Tyrion is no at the mercy of slave traders and Jorah is infected. Both are in about as tenuous situation as there can be. Cersei has embraced the Sparrows and has taken on Margery full force, having her cast into prison. She is still ruling the kingdom and Tommen is just a little boy, hopelessly out of his league. Theon still has a bit of nobility in him (though he always was a coward) and may have been pushed to the brink. Sansa has been given to Ramsay and he is doing what he always does. He is a delightfully awful character whom we grow to hate with each passing minute. Then there is the princess who has embraced her new life in a far off land and has fallen in love with a suitor. She is going to be hard to rescue, since her saviors are now captured and she is so resistant to being rescued. With Circei back home, one can only imagine. Also, Littlefinger has made a packed with the evil queen mother for his own gain. She is putting a lot of eggs in his basket. The closing scene is terrifying, but only because of the buildup. So many have suffered throughout this story, so Sansa is not going to walk through everything unscathed. Can't wait for the next episode."
109," WOW!!!
",10,True,This is the best episode of this season so far. This season started with slow pace. Ramsay Bolton is becoming new joeffry baratheon. Sansa stark is really one unlucky woman when it comes to marriage. The final scenes are really unbearable to watch.
110," Not the show I fell in love with
",7,False,"First 4 seasons I couldn't wait to watch the next episode, this season I couldn't care more. I was waiting for the story to build up, but 6 episodes have passed and - nothing. We used to gasp at the events, discuss the reasons behind actions, bet on what would happen next. To me this show represented real life - brutal, sudden, dark... with a few decent human beings among ruthless beasts.Yes, I felt bad for some of the events, but I was not watching GOT to feel bad, I was watching it to feel the life in it. What I see now are cheesy scenes and pitiful events, nothing more. To me, it became more like a lot of other shows just in different costumes. We just cancelled our subscription to HBO Now as we had it only to watch this show."
111," one of worst and poorest episodes of GOT.
",4,False,"one of worst and poorest episodes of GOT. battle scene between prince O'Brien's girls and king slayer was super terrible, very poor very low quality and so far from GOT's class.the ending scene of episode completed the misery. the only way writer knows to make show great and attractive is to shock people with torturing scenes of characters which they like, characters that have more humanity, more kindness and in overall good humans! this way worked at first, with executing Ned stark and killing rob stark, but not anymore! why we should watch sansa (an innocent poor kind girl!) get raped by a crazy psycho bastard and hear her whines? should we enjoy this scene?does always seeing good people go to misery makes a movie great ?"
112," No real surprises but a sign of what's to come
",8,True,"After an epic episode 5 where everything seemed to happen and there were twists and turns at every corner, this episode seemed to take stock and set up for the remaining 4 episodes of the season.It was a good time to strengthen some characters, their relationships and the relationships we have with them. A time to remember why we love certain characters and why we hate others.Tyrion and Bronn gave us quotes only they can and endeared us to their cause that little bit more. The ninja turtle Sand girls let us down with a fairly poor fighting scene. Tyrion and Jorah get to save their legs and receive a fast track to the fighting pit, thanks to some Slavers. Baelish was up to his usual bag of tricks, as well as Cersei continuing her refusal to roll over and have her belly scratched.Theon seemed back to being Theon (but still at a crossroad of who he is and who he fights for) and it was a stark (haha pun intended) contrast for Sansa; she finally grew a pair and stood up to someone, before being robbed of all dignity and becoming yet another passenger to Ramsay and his sadistic ways. For a moment you think Theon might react and help Sansa, but judging by how pivotal Ramsay has been this season that would just be too easy.The usually unmoved and powerful Lady Olenna failed in her attempt to remind Cersei of the ongoing dependence on House Tyrell. Consequently the now Queen and the Heir to Highgarden fell into an obvious trap and were remanded by the Faith Militant. Marjorie called on King Tommen to assist - he however continues to be a wet noodle; the ""King"" proving powerless and naive when pitted against the tact of his mother."
113," Game Of Thrones Going No Where
",1,False,"This episode has got to be a perfect proof of the deteriorating quality of Game of Thrones episodes lately. Why do I say that? Well, let's just start with how Dorne's story is unfolding. In the last few episodes, we see Oberyn's lover plotting with his daughters for revenge against the Lannisters. Knowing that it would culminate into a full blown confrontation between the duo from King's Landing and the Sand Snakes, we were hoping for an exhilarating fight to say the least and some irrevocable damage that was to be inflicted on the possibility of peace between the two clans (exemplified by Myrcella's scar in the book). Instead, what we got was some really badly orchestrated fight between the two factions and an absolutely anti-climatic end to all of the plotting. What was the whole point of this? It seems like the writers had only intended to drag the story on. Moving on to Winterfell, Sansa got ready for her big night and ends up out-witting a lowly servant girl in her attempts to unnerve her. Are we supposed to rejoice? Is this a victory? Is this the moment when Sansa finds her footing? That this scene would be the answer to these questions would be belittling the question itself. Sansa STARK would never have problems out- witting servants. Her problems have been far graver and her torturers truly powerful people, confronting whom would require not wit and contempt but true power and strength. When I realized that Sansa was to be Jeyne's substitute, I knew this scene would come and from the books I do know what's in store for Sansa is worse. Now the reason why I am unhappy with this scenario is because in the books, she has time and opportunity to gain strength and truly come onto her own. But here, she has yet again been reduced to a play-thing for perverts. Since she is again helpless against her tormentors,we are left to wondering when her rescuer would come to save her (maybe Brienne, Theon or whoever, but never herself) - a truly nauseating prospect. The show writers have clearly sacrificed Sansa's character growth for some cheap horror shots. Now why did I rate this revolting episode a 2 and not a 1 or 0 (not sure if 0 is an option)? Well that would be because of a few (precisely two) moments of redemption, like Tyrion thinking on his feet and Arya's lie. I am seriously reconsidering watching the series because of the bitter aftertaste left by this episode."
114," Poorly done!
",1,False,"I did not like the change in Sansa's story line at all! Maybe they wanted to make her story more interesting but they failed at that, I believe. What happened to Sansa was completely unnecessary, like she hasn't had enough! Why should she endure this? To become stronger? Utter crap! I'd suggest to the writers to stick to the books and not to make such drastic changes to the events!The fighting scene of the sand snakes was horrible as well, very poorly done, it felt like they did not even rehearse the battle choreography or something. The only thing I liked was the progress in Arya's story. Nothing else.What has happened to them this season? Are they in a hurry to wrap it up?"
115," This show goes too far from what's written the book to my taste.
",1,False,"I can't believe my eyes - this show goes too far from the book to my liking. It is very disappointing to witness. I could off accept this, if they made it better than the book but in fact they dropped quite a few very important characters and lines of their development and this show looks very poor compare to the book. Those who had a chance to read the book can understand what I mean exactly. I am astonished how freely the authors of the show juggle with the characters and the plot of the books. It is rather a parody then a screen adaptation how I see that more and more. I am giving up watching this HBO show and will be waiting for new books to come."
116," The worst GOT episode
",1,False,"This season, every episode has been progressively worse than the previous one. I've never written a review before but this episode was so god-awful! I've been a huge fan of the show, but this season has been utter crap. 6 episodes into the season and it looks like the only thing the creators of the show are doing is trying to build things up, but it leads to nowhere. Talking about this episode almost every conversation was a filler- Jaime and Myrcella, Dany and Dario, the Septon and the Queen of thorns, however the one between the sand sisters and Bronn has to be the worst, hands down; why poison the guy and then throw in the anti dote, all while the sand sister is getting naked - cheap sleaze fest anyone? The part about the high Septon is downright ridiculous. So you throw Loras in prison and then the queen Margarie and not a single Lord, Knight, no one as much as squeaks! Why are all these lords fighting amongst themselves to sit on the Iron Throne when all you need to do is influence the Septon - take him out for a beer, make him your best bud. The Game of Thrones feels more like the game of laughs."
117," Sweet Girls Get a Bit Dumb
",9,True,"I really loved how female centric this episode was. If only Daenerys was in it to legitimize it even more. And for the most part, it exemplified strong character moments for all of our favorite female characters. It turned out to be one of if not the best episode of the season so far. Game of Thrones has always been great at giving us backstabbing moments that actually make sense and don't feel forced, and I feel like this was a perfect example of an episode that focused on it. Plus, this episode definitely felt like the first step into the absolute chaotic second half of the season.We began in Braavos where Arya continued her training into becoming no one. Even though Arya has probably had the least amount of screen-time out of the main cast members this year, her scenes at the House of Black and White have felt tedious. With that being said, the dungeon of heads or whatever was pretty cool. And I was glad to see that it seems as though her training is picking up a bit. Speaking of the Starks, Sansa had a big night, but not necessarily a good one. Anytime the show has a wedding, I get nervous for the characters. I half expected to Brienne to break up the party, or maybe even Theon. But what I was really hoping for was Theon killing Ramsay while he raped Sansa. It was heartbreaking watching Sansa go through something like that after all she has been through, and Theon's face seemed to signal him helping her. But she did have a great scene with Myranda in which she completely out smarted her and I'm sure eventually will prove that she will not be one of those 'dumb girls'.Baelish arrived at Kings Landing to set another one of his schemes in motion. When he revealed to Cersei that Sansa was still alive, I thought for a second that he had bad intentions but in typical Baelish form, he had more up his sleeve. This time he wants to be named Warden of the North. That's something I would be okay with, as long as the Bolton's get what they deserve. Meanwhile, Cersei once again plotted against Margaery. It's been fun all season watching the two go at matching blows week to week. Putting her on trial with her brother for having homosexual experiences is pretty brutal. And it shows us again just how little power Tommen actually has.Onto our favorite road trip duos, Tyrion and Jorah bonded over their father issues, that is until they were captured by slavers. I feel like the whole being 'captured on a road trip' thing is getting a bit annoying but at least the slavers are headed towards Meereen. If anything else, tonight was a great episode for these two and their scenes erase the brutal final scene. Where's Varys when we need him? Jaimie and Bronn arrived but ended up in a battle with the strange sand snakes. Bronn was another character I thought may kick the bucket tonight, thankfully he did not, and gave us the hilarious 'oh for fuc** sake line'. So now being over half way through the season, I'm very excited to see how the season ends. And hopefully the show delivers on many of the promises it's seemingly making.+Road trip duos +Cersei vs Margaery +Baelish plots again +Bronn +Arya getting closer -Theon should have redeemed himself -I felt Dany's absence 9.1/10"
118," An eventful, thematically smart episode that makes one big mistake.
",6,False,"After a middling installment last week, Game of Thrones' fifth season is back on track and the momentum is moving again. Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken is arguably the most eventful episode of the season yet: Ramsay and Sansa married; the Faith Militant arrested the Queen of Westeros; Arya finally made real progress in her training; Jaime briefly relocated his daughter in Dorne and the Sand Snakes attacked. But episode six also returned to the style of the first four episodes by having a solid theme run through each of the narrative arcs. Whereas last week's Kill the Boy failed to offer a strong thematic link between its uneventful narratives, Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken displayed something quite simple: honesty.This theme is most present in Arya's outing this week, in which she learns that there is a lot more to becoming no-one that she previously envisioned. ""Did you believe a word I said?"", the Waif asks Arya, ""Was I telling the truth or was I lying?"". This brief encounter visibly shakes Arya, leading to potentially her best scene of the season yet. As Jaqen H'Ghar quizzes her on her former life, striking her down every time she lies, we come to learn a lot more about Arya than we did before; despite everything she attempted to make him believe, she never hated the Hound. This theme also resonates clearly in Loras' trial, in which he and his sister, Queen Margaery, lie repeatedly, only to result in both of their arrests. It may not compare to the trial we saw in last season's episode six, in which Tyrion took down the entirety of the upper class of King's Landing, but it's a terrific sequence nonetheless; any moment involving Lena Headey, Natalie Dormer and Diana Rigg in the same scene is bound to steal the episode.The episode's most resonating scene, though, comes at the very close. Game of Thrones has always been controversial in its depiction of sexual violence, and has (on more than one occasion) adapted a consensual sex scene from the source novels into a rape sequence for the show. Whilst Sansa's rape at the end of the episode isn't adapted from a consensual moment in the novel (it isn't in the novel at all, in fact) it still feels morbidly unnecessary. It's a tonally dark sequence, as Ramsay forces Reek to watch as ""the girl he grew up with becomes a woman"", and undoubtedly the most disturbing thing we've been given all season. But, for some reason, the whole scene fails to feel justified. Myranda essentially informs Sansa, and the audience, what will happen after the wedding, so the viewer is well aware of the ordeal Sansa will endure that night. I feel the outcome of this would hit harder if we hadn't seen it, and had rather caught up with Sansa at the beginning of next week's episode. Unless, perhaps, the show is prepared to delve into this deeper and uncover the more psychological motivations and impacts of the moment, but this seems unlikely. Otherwise, it feels like yet another mere exploitation for simple shock value, only reconfirmed by the writers' decision to use Sansa's rape as the episodes conclusion. Absent this week was Daenerys, as well as Jon Snow and Stannis Baratheon, ultimately allowing more time to be fleshed out with the stories we were offered. Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken benefits from being the most eventful episode of the season thus far, and its thematic umbrellas of truth, deceit and honesty gives the episode a nice focus that was lacking last week. But it's bogged down by something I thought the show was long past by now and, regrettably, whilst the stories are finally advancing, nothing is looking anywhere close to a satisfying conclusion with just four episodes to go. We know the show will return next year, and every year until the story is finished, but season five is unfortunately looking set to be the show's weakest year thus far. It is rich thematically and remains fantastically written and superbly performed, but the narrative hold seems to be dropping, and I'm unsure how much longer the show can survive on setup."

120," I'm Out
",1,False,"The last scene was clearly unnecessary and probably written just to stir controversy. Not because of the book, not because Sansa was precious, not because of the fact that life doesn't turn out to be a fairy tail. Simply because after we get the idea, screams of the character went on. Because it was a torment to watch that unnecessarily long scene. Because they probably wanted it to be something to remembered. Well, that was just sick. These kind of scenes really started to take place longer than necessary. I highlight the word especially ""necessary"" and ""unnecessary"". They've got definitely one of the best stories in their hands. Now I can understand they wanted the show to be different than the book. But if it's gonna be with pervertedly violence and especially highlighting these scenes after we watchers clearly understand what's going on, then I don't want to watch the show. Makers of game of thrones after this point should really question themselves:Could they tell more about the events or do they really want to hurt people psychologically just to get more attention?I was a real fan and if I'm disappointed and I've read people also disturbed, then the kind of attitude should not be like ""that's a show and we do it"". Well, that's your show and if only you could manage a lot of people to watch it till this episode and it really became in fact that way ""your show""; and after all of this you made quite a lot of them angry at you, that seems like a problem to me."
121," Winter is Here
",9,True,"Last week had many critics as has this entire season, but I think episode 7 proved that this season is finally in full throttle. Most of the main cast was in the episode and we got possibly the coolest moment of the entire season.We began in the north for the better part of the first 30 minutes, and it was pretty slow paced. Jon Snow left for the wildlings and the wall began to crumble. We also lost the old Targaryen died and Sam has barely any friends left. Which put Gilly in a bad position as we nearly had yet another rape scene. I was kind of hoping Sam would end up killing those guys. Ghost saving them felt too easy. And then to go on and have him and Gilly hook up felt tonally off. It was a pretty awkward scene to watch. Elsewhere in the north, Stannis is ready to march onto Winterfell but Melisandre has other plans. They are really painting Stannis as a much better guy this season so I hope he doesn't somehow give up his daughter to Melisandre. In Winterfell, Sansa plots against Ramsay with Theon, which predictably so turns south. Sophie Turner really shined this week as both a strong and broken character. She's come a long way since her season 1 days. But it was really heartbreaking to watch Ramsay get away with all that he does. Brienne has had a long enough break, wouldn't we all love to see her kill him?Onto our favorite road trip comedy, Tyrion and Jorah. Their story picked up this week as they were sold into the fighting pits. It was nice to see Tyrion doing some as* kicking this week instead of the opposite way around. But by far the coolest scene of the season was seeing them meet up with Dany. Jorah brought his 'gift' to Dany, Tyrion. I don't see a good future for Jorah, but Tyrion's situation could wind up being a great turn for both the characters. They need each other. Back in Kings Landing, we have several, and I mean several, great scenes with the High Sparrow. We know Margaery and Loras are in jail and about to be on trial but I don't think we expected to see Cersei get the same treatment. She is easily one of the top 5 characters on the show so this becomes probably the top storyline of the future. The end of this season could turn out to have more WTF's than any of the past seasons.It's worth mentioning that Bronn had an entertaining scene with the sand snakes, although I didn't really see the point for it other than comedic relief. Can we assume that he's cured now? It just seemed too easy. Also, Olenna Tyrell had a great scene with the High Sparrow and Littlefinger. I love how one week it seems like he's on one side and then the next week it's the opposite. He's just a fascinating character and always a joy to watch. It was nice to see him help the Tyrell's out there too as that was his 'Gift'. Well, there you have it, probably my favorite and most shocking episode of the season so far. Here's to winter! +Sophie Turner+Snow takes charge +Sam steps up +My name is Tyrion Lannister +High Sparrow scenes +Cersei is going down +Littlefinger plans -Gilly scenes felt off -No point to the Bronn scene, is he safe? 9.6/10"
122," The arrival of winter
",10,True,"Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.Personally liked to loved all the previous episodes of Season 5, which judging from the negative comments for the previous episode ""Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken"" doesn't seem to be a popular opinion. Up to this point however, ""The Gift"" is the best and a big improvement over the polarising (and to me well done episode hampered by the stuff with the Sand Snakes) ""Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken"".What are the reasons for my saying this? It's the tightest paced episode up to this point in Season 5, it's the most jam-packed (in a good way, a lot happens but it doesn't feel too much), long awaited answers are provided and the character and story development show the most signs compared to the previous Season 5 episodes of moving forward rather than reiterating or feeling like filler. ""The Gift"" and ""Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken"" as well deserve credit for making Sansa the most interesting she's been in a long time and making me see Theon in a different light, instead of being the nasty piece of work he was previously part of me felt for him. There is a lot of intrigue and suspense, Tyrion and Jorah's storyline is very entertaining and the action is neatly executed. Actually found myself emotionally invested and interested in the Dorne storyline and the nudity in the prison scene was a non-issue.'Game of Thrones' always delivers on the acting. ""The Gift"" is no exception and can find no casting issues. Peter Dinklage, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and Diana Rigg are particularly exemplary.Visually, ""The Gift"" looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about ""The Gift"" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.Script-wise, throughout the humour, mystery, wide emotional ranges and thought-provoking layers are present and the storytelling is passionate and sensitive. Overall, wonderful episode and one of Season 5's best. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
123," And there goes the boom... Beautiful emotional episode
",10,True,"After a slow-paced start to this season things are finally picking up in this episode. We finally get to see Tyrion meet Daenerys and Cerci's ""master plan"" pay off. This episode also brought out some of the best acting i have seen on this show so far, from Cerci and Tommens emotional scene, to Sam, Gilly and the High Sparrow. Although for me Sansa delivered the best scene I have seen from her on the show. After being raped and tormented by Ramsey see really made me feel for her with her emotional plea for help to Theon/Reek. For me this was clearly the best episode of the season (so far at least) and I expect plots to develop pretty rapidly from this point onwards, especially for Jon considering the title of next weeks episode. 10/10."
124," The Best Episode of the Fifth Season
",9,True,"Jon Snow rides with Tormund Giantsbane to meet the Wildlings; Aemon Targeryan dies; and Sam is left alone in Castle Black. Sansa asks Theon to light a candle in the broken tower to help her; however he betrays her. Stannis' army is weak with the cold winter but he decides to continue to march to Winterfell. Melisandre wants to sacrifice Stannis' daughter to victory. Tyrion and Jorah are sold to fight in the arena. Lady Olenna has a conversation with the High Sparrow about the destiny of Margaery and Loras Tyrell. Bronn was poisoned by one Sand Snake, but she gives the antidote to him. Jorah sees Daenerys in the arena and he shows his gift to her. Cersei goes to the Black Cells to visit and annoy Margaery and the High Sparrow gives a surprise to her. ""The Gift"" is the best episode of the Fifth Season of Game of Thrones. Jon Snow's journey will begin in the Wildling lands. Sansa discovers how despicable Theon is. Will Stannis accept the sacrifice proposed by Melisandre? Lady Oleanna is trying to save her grandchildren at any cost. The encounter between Jorah and Daenerys is tense. But the best part is the fate of Cersei after meeting the High Sparrow. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""The Gift"""
125," A LIttle Too Smug, Eh!
",10,True,"This is such a good episode. We have significant advancement of the plot, lots of action, characters moving forward or backward, striking mistakes, and some justice. We begin with John Snow leading men into battle. While he is in command technically, loyalty is at a premium and he must watch his back. Sam wishes him well. Gully's assault brings Sam to exert himself. He reaches a ""fight or die"" conclusion, even though he has few of the tools to manage. Ramsay continues to persecute Sansa and Theon still lives in fear. Of course, at work are a couple of things. The birth of a non-bastard son in the offing and his self proclaimed status in the kingdom. He has delusions of grandeur that are going to be put to the test at some point. Jorah and Tyrion are sold as slaves to fight in an arena. Dany allows this fight to go ahead to appease the wish for tradition in her current setting. Jorah is wishing to reclaim himself, but when he stands before her, she rejects him. But then she is given a gift. We also have action back at the castle as Cersei is playing her hand. Margery and her brother are in prison, kept in a horrible dungeon. Cersei believes the High Sparrow is her ally. Margery's mother confronts the High Sparrow and makes threats unless Margery is released. The child King, Tommen is wrapped around his mother's finger, thinking she has Margery's best interest in mind. Cersei, of course, is pure evil and smugly thinks that she is in control. The episode ends with one of the best scenes in the entire series."
126," Winter is definitely coming
",9,True,"After Jon heads off from Castle Black the situation becomes perilous for Sam and Gilly; without Jon's protection other members of the watch voice their doubts on Sam's claim to have slain a white walker as two of them make improper advances on Gilly. Sansa is in an even more precarious position in Winterfell; locked up during the day and at the mercy of Ramsey Bolton's perverse whims during the night; she seeks help from Theon but will this broken man be able to help her? Elsewhere in the north Stannis's army are held up in the snow; Lord Davos suggests that they return to Castle Black but Stannis is adamant that they continue to Winterfell; whether in victory or defeat he is determined that their campaign continues.In the capital Olenna Tyrell goes to see High Sparrow but finds that he can't be persuaded to release her grandchildren. The King is also determined to see Margaery released and his mother, Cersei, agrees to try to help of course she has no such intentions and visits Margaery just to taunt her. This doesn't mean things go her way; she may be trying to use the High Sparrow and his followers but their motives are very different and she is playing a dangerous game without even knowing it. Further south, in Dorne, Jaime learns that his daughter has no intention of returning to King's Landing and Bronn has a talk with the Sand Snakes in the dungeons. Across the Narrow Sea in Essos Tyrion and Jorah Mormont are sold as slaves to fight in the pits this leads to an unexpected meeting between Jorah and Daenerys.This was another really good episode with plenty of tension; some interesting plot developments and a nice twist involving Cersei and High Sparrow. The opening scenes snow us that winter is definitely coming in the North as snow falls on both Castle Black and Winterfell. The mood is almost as cold as we see Sam and Gilly's situation get distinctly more dangerous, even if that does bring them closer together, and things are even worse for Sansa as she learns that her situation is worse than she thought; she may have friends in the north but she has no way of contacting them; the one person she thought could help her is far too broken. Sophie Turner and Alfie Allen did fine jobs as Sansa and Theon. The scenes featuring Peter Dinklage and Iain Glen, as Tyrion and Jorah Mormont continue to some of the series more light-hearted moments although they also provide some of the best action when we see Jorah defeat numerous fighters before revealing his identity to Daenerys. The best moments were saved for Queen Cersei; Lena Headey does a great job portraying one of the most devious and self-serving women in Westeros; first she is telling her son that she will do what she can for Margaery; then she is tormenting her in a way that could almost be considered friendly if we didn't know she didn't mean a word she said and Margaery knew it, finally her reaction to her reversal of fortunes was great; although I doubt many will sympathise with the character's plight. Overall this was one of the best episodes of the season."
127," Revenge is sweet...but this time it's delicious!
",10,True,"I hate to say it, but more happened in this episode than in the last three combined. This is why I think David Benioff and D. B. Weiss are the best writers, because they understand how the show needs to progress, and how to set out the perfect scenes. Bryan Cogman is good, but there's a heavy concentration on major revelations, rather than fleshing them out a bit more, and ultimately the scenes seem unfinished and imperfect. Dave Hill's new to the game, so we can't blame him, but his episode certainly did have some significant moments.Anyhow, whilst the episode itself may seem quite quiet, as in there's nothing predominantly game- changing, Benioff and Weiss counter that with some deeply satisfying plot twists and dialogue that will knock your woolly socks off. Not to mention that a number of characters get some heavy development, including Samwell, Stannis, Olenna, Bronn, and of course our dearest Cersei. Stakes are high in the world of Game of Thrones, and when they're high, the writers get a chance to open things out a little. It could've been a mess, considering the fact that the writers had to fit 22 starring cast members into just under an hour of television - and to do it so deftly - is notorious of these show runners.In the North, people are scattering, with Jon heading north-east to Hardhome and to hopefully start a new relationship with the help of Tormund Giantsbane. Samwell get some much-needed character development, particularly in showing his outright loyalty to Gilly. She rewards him kindly, and there's a real intimate relationship brewing. Also, we get to see glimpse of Ghost again. Stannis is also making a stand, this time to Melisandre, who has controversially stated that Shireen may be used in a sacrifice to Rhllor to help the King's cause, something that I doubt he would ever let happen. Equally, Ramsay is still holding his ground at Winterfell, but Sansa still has some fire within her yet - she's picked up a weapon after all. The shot of Brienne watching from afar is superbly envisioned - like a guardian angel, watching and waiting for the right moment. If only Theon had done the right thing.In King's Landing, the Tyrell family gains a little back. A word joust between Olenna and the High Sparrow, followed by another with Baelish, leads to Cersei's imprisonment. It's great to see the true nature of the High Sparrow and how Lady Olenna realises that the Faith is more than just a group of people - they actually believe in justice. And to see Cersei's demise was a truly satisfying moment. Jonathan Pryce couldn't have played it better.In Dorne, we learn two things. Myrcella may be a lost cause unless Jaime can somehow persuade her otherwise, and the Sand Snakes really should not be messed with. We see a side of Bronn that we haven't seen before, scared and desperate. After all, he wanted a quiet death, and the poison in Tyene's dagger was far from what he wanted. More is needed though before the end of this season - the Dorne storyline still feels incomplete.Finally, in Meereen, the moment has happened that we've been expecting for a long while - Tyrion's meeting with Daenerys. Ser Jorah's love for seeing her is priceless, because we can't see how much he's wanted to see her. His battle with his fellow warriors is short-lived but enough for us to anticipate what happens next. Daenerys' expression explains it all. But if next week's trailer is anything to go by, Ser Jorah may still be struggling to find a place in Khaleesi's court.From start to finish, this a stunning hour of television, giving this season a surge forward into the final three episodes, where I can see a lot of things happening. Game of Thrones continues to be one of my very favourite TV series, mainly because it is able to progress through a world- building structure in quite a serious fashion and continues to display realistic characters going through their realistic emotions. Almost flawless this week.9.5/10"
128," Pretty grim
",9,True,This episode represents a turn for the worse for some of the characters - but there's also some newfound light in the darkness.
129," Emotions and drama run high in Game of Thrones' best episode in ages.
",9,True,"So Game of Thrones' fifth season has finally given us its first truly perfect episode, almost three quarters of the way into this year's run. It's been very easy to label this season as the show's weakest year; after all, it did come off the back of what is arguably one of the most eventful seasons of any TV show, period. But the show's renewed emphasis on weighty thematic ideas and intricate character work has let us to this, and now season five has but three episodes left to take us back to the big, explosive Westeros we came to love in the first few seasons. The Gift is far and away the best episode of this season yet, in fact I think I'd have to go further back to season four's stellar The Laws of Gods and Men to find the last episode that topped this one. It may not represent Game of Thrones at its most shockingly dramatic, but The Gift is a surprisingly emotional episode, reinforced by concrete character development, some huge plot leaps and the best writing we've had all year. Welcome back, Westeros.When I label this episode an ""emotional"" one, I don't mean it in the terms of making the viewer cry or eliciting an actual emotional response in the audience. Rather, The Gift felt content in allowing characters to put their own loved ones first, creating an episode in which even Cersei was almost likable. Even those who hate Cersei and everything she stands for would struggle to not feel something for her as she talks with Tommon about family values and what that means to her; if Cersei has one overall redeeming quality, it is that she loves her children more than anything in her world. Sam and Gilly were also treated to an emotional sequence this week, following the upsetting but unsurprising death of Maester Aemon. Sam and Gilly have been two of my favourite characters in this show for a long time now, so it was great to seem them given some truly serious stuff to play with, as both of them handled it with ease. Also shocking was Melisandre's (still Game of Thrones's most captivating on screen presence) request that Stannis sacrifice his own daughter in order to aid his advancement to Winterfell. Stannis shot this idea down instantly, further emphasising this episode's focus on family.This episode really comes into form in it's final fifteen minutes, though, in which two of the show's most beloved characters finally come into contact for the first time, and it was seamless. Jorah's unveiling of himself in front of Daenerys was a superbly tense moment, leaving the audience unsure as to which way Dany would fall. She soon answers that question with a resounding ""Get him out of my sight"", before Tyrion makes his presence known in what I would happily label the season's most exciting sequence yet. Any other episode and this would take the final scene, but The Gift had more to tell. Last week we watched as both Loras and Margaery Tyrell were arrested by the Faith Militant for lying under oath, but I don't think anyone expected the following episode to result in Cersei herself succumbing to the same fate. Lancel's reveal was handled expertly, and Jonathon Pryce delivered arguably the best monologue of the season as the High Sparrow built to Cersei's arrest. The entire final act of episode seven was simply masterful stuff.It may have taken a little longer to reach perfection than the show's other seasons, but this year's Game of Thrones is a very different show, as outlined in my review for episode one seven weeks back. Westeros is a different world to what it once was, and this is reflected in the show itself. Whilst it has been easy, and justifiable, to label this season disappointing, should the following three episodes sustain the narrative momentum we saw here, then season five could be able to claw its way back. I barely had time here to discuss Theon's betrayal of Sansa, or the fact that a Sand Snake was given solid screen time and actually performed well; there was just so much to talk about suddenly. The first six episodes were set up, and that phase did last far too long for a ten episode season (60% setup is difficult to justify), but if these upcoming episodes return to Game of Thrones' explosive roots, they could ultimately hit harder than ever because of this. If the show takes a step down again next week, then The Gift may end up feeling like a misplaced lightning fast episode dropped into a slow, set-up season. Either way, it's the best thing this show has done all year."
130," A classic episode that improves on the first six episodes
",10,True,"After the controversial Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken, The Gift is a very satisfying episode that improves on the first six episodes. It does a neat job advancing the plot progression while making the relationships remain interesting. Plus it has some action in it which is really cool to watch. And no, there aren't any problems I have with this episode because it's great to see things getting better than ever.The performances are still great, the characters are still believable, the pacing never drags and doesn't become uneven, the story/script improves on the weak writing that episode six had, the directing and editing is still sharp, the music score from Ramin Djawadi continues to be beautifully atmospheric, the action is really cool to watch and the plot progression, like I said before, is advanced very neatly.So, overall, a classic episode and an improvement over Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken, which I thought was pretty good, but not without it's flaws. :)"
131," Last effort when chocolate and flower don't work anymore
",8,True,"The winter has arrived, much like real life its timely arrival coincides with a great war. After the perverse pounding scene from last episode, Theon and Sansa are still trudging through their own ordeals. It's a bit disturbing, especially concerning Theon who is farther from redemption with each episode. Stannis, on the other hand, suffers losses even before the war begins. As Jon Snow's supposed reinforcement is still away, a desperate measure is presented in front of him.Much of the time spent in North is with Sam. He has proved to be resilient and while not in usual conventional fashion, he is heroic in his own right. It's nice to see an ordinary man amidst the warlords and scheming generals. King's Landing has no shortage of those as houses play with politic, faith and knowledge. Olenna Tyrell does everything in her power to free her grandchildren. She might find the power her house holds is dwindling as the faith grows in strength, dangerously so.In Dorne Jamie has little progress on convincing his love struck daughter/niece. He has had no luck with women or children, so this might take him a while. One of more intriguing moments happens with the favorite sell-sword Bronn who secretly has a talent to become a bard and his newly acquainted female warrior who has more weapons in her arsenal. The interaction between them is witty, seductive and entertaining in strangely lethal manner.The royalties have equally surprising encounters. Lena Headey as Cersei gives a bizarre yet compelling display of affection. Even with her usual cold demeanor, she is convincingly passionate when it comes to her children. It's personal for her because Margeary sees his son as chess piece while Cersei truly adores him unconditionally.The episode closes as Jorah makes his last gambit to gain the affection of women he lost. After investing so much, it's hard not to cheer for one of the most underdog characters of the series. It also presents one of the most awaited meetings of the series, which should present faster development for things to come."
132," Amazing Well-Planned Episode.
",9,True,"This Episode is so good. It is well-planned. It's about The Gift, Jorah's gift, Gilly's gift, and Littlefinger's gift. as well as that dornish girl's gift. I'm not good as describing so this is it. A really good episode. Make me want watch the next one so bad."
133," Getting better
",7,False,"THE GIFT is something of a step up from the previous instalment, less unpleasant and more entertaining generally. The step downs are an openly pornographic scene in the cells with the awful Dorne daughters and a gratuitous bed scene with Daenerys. The arena fight scene comes on suddenly and unexpectedly and reaffirms what we already knew about Ser Jorah and his fighting abilities, a real burst of adrenaline, this one. The final scene with Cersei is possibly the most satisfying of the whole show, and the most satisfaction we've had since the days of Tyrion destroying Joffrey. I admit to getting small pleasure out of Sam's humiliation, which humanises a character previously indestructible to anyone and everything."

Lady Olenna wants her grandchildren released from the King's Landing prison but is refused - she also speaks with Littlefinger and more information is revealed concerning the Lannisters and themselves.

My score: 10/10 if I could give it more I definitely would! Pure brilliance."
142," Belief is the Death of Reason
",10,True,"Season 5 to most fans has been the weakest season, that is until last week and then tonight's episode. Wow, back to back phenomenal episodes that finally paid off some of the things that has been teased for quite some time. Coming off of last week's legendary moment with Daenerys and Tyrion meeting for the first time, I figured this week would start fast but then slow down and set up a lot more for the last two episodes of the season. Instead we got a high octane thrill ride and easily the best episode of the season.The scenes with Dany and Tyrion were great this week. It's just really cool to watch these two characters interact with each other after so long. They both are incredibly stubborn with plenty of wit so the dynamic between them should keep us entertained for awhile. I was glad to see Dany ultimately decide on letting Tyrion advise her after asking all the questions we knew she would ask about him. But I was sad to see Jorah go. We know he will be fighting in the pits but will he die there or from the stone disease? It seems unlikely that Dany will ever let him back into her circle at this point. Even so, we know his death is inevitable at some point, but I just hope he goes out honorably. We then cut to Kings Landing where Cersei is spending her time rotting away in a cell. I never thought I would see Cersei lick water off the ground. It's interesting that while Tyrion was locked up last season, Jaime visited him often. But yet when Cersei is in jail, the only person that came to visit her was that scientist who's working on the mountain. Not even her own son and the king himself has came to see her. I'm not sure how this story ends up, but I hope they conclude it by the end of the season. I don't want to have to wait a full year for all 3 trials.We got a brief Sansa scene in the north where she finds out that her brothers are still alive. I was glad to see him tell Sansa and it was a glimpse of Theon left in Reek and a hope that he will redeem himself at some point. I would like to see him help Sansa escape somehow but that ship has seemed to have sailed. And Brienne can get her revenge on Stannis, but I would assume the latter stays alive this season. Back at Castle Black, Sam had a quick scene in which I thought was setting up the last half of the episode by saying ""Jon always comes back"". I was worried for Snow. And did anybody have any idea that it would be this much of a white walker episode? Jon had a great moment rallying the wildlings only to have a huge battle and lose half the wildlings. What an epic battle it was. But Jon Snow and his valyrian steel prevailed, at least for now. I think the white walkers are a bigger threat than people are giving them credit for. Then again, I would assume the dragons could do one swoop in, breathe fire, and kill them all within minutes. But the defining scene was the silent stare down between the head white walker and Jon Snow. Maybe that's a foreshadow of next season or the season after when they next meet. So with only a few episodes left, Game of Thrones is picking up a bit. Plus, next week is the infamous 9th episode of the season, oh boy.+Tyrion & Dany dynamic +Sansa demanding Theon +Valyrian steel +Cersei dropping real low +Spokes on a wheel +Stare down 10/10"
143," A Damn Good Episode
",10,True,"This season has been a bit of a disappointment to fans of the book, and the directors have been getting more playful in terms of script and action, which for a series like this, is very risky.This episode brought back the grit and terror we love about the series, and the way it deviated from the book was surprisingly nice. The battle at Hardhome was not in the book, but it was one of the most intense battles of the series, and we got to see the whitewalkers fully in action, instead of the slow-walking horrors we are used to. And in the book, we learn that Valyrian steel also functions as a weapon against the whitewalkers, when Sam reads it in a book. But the show has chosen a much better way to reveal it, and for that I am pleased.I can't wait to see the battle between mankind and whitewalkers that we are all anticipating for the end of the series. This episode has given us a glimpse of how that may look."
144," Utterly Phenomenal
",10,True,"If this is what Winter looks like - the thing we've been craving for five seasons now - then I'm not sure I want it anymore.In every respect, this episode redeems this season for its dragging nature in the preceding episodes. Many criticised this season of venturing too far from the books, condemning the writers and giving up on the show. Well I bet they're all eating their hats now.Daenerys and Tyrion are purely brilliant together. Two characters I have loved since the very beginning have finally come together and formed an alliance - and a strong one at that. With Daenerys' power and Tyrion's expertise I can only imagine what excellence will come of their alliance.Arya's storyline is also picking up, as we observe her getting her first mission as a servant of the Many-Faced-God. Just like Daenerys and Tyrion, I cannot wait to see what comes of Arya's training.Cersei finally gets what's been coming to her since the very first episode. Justice is sweet - is it not? Her stubbornness and pride is what is keeping her imprisoned - indeed, this is the case with Margaery and Loras as well - and if Ned's experience with pride and honour is anything to go by, the three of them had better act quickly and relinquish their pride in order to save themselves. And of course: Hardhome. I will confess that I did not see this coming at all. I had no idea we would get another glimpse at the army of the dead so soon, and as a result I was absolutely mortified when the dogs began barking, the wind began whistling, and the clouds swirled overhead. The battle of Hardhome was the most horrific battle yet. It easily sets into perspective how insignificant the Game of Thrones is in comparison to the White Walkers and the damage they can deal our beloved characters. In the final scene of the episode, we get an idea of just how hopeless the future may be. As there are hundreds of Wildlings lying dead, we see them slowly rising and the army growing as quickly as it was diminished. This only amplifies the horror as we realise that the White Walkers are what we need to fear the most. Can they be defeated? Well, we're at least given a glimmer of hope as Jon manages to kill a White Walker thanks to his Valyrian steel sword. I honestly believed it was the end for Jon as we saw him fall that great height and then feebly stumble out into the snow. I was relieved and just as shocked as the White Walker when his sword did not crumble and he eliminated his foe. The Dragonglass may be lost, but if enough Valyrian steel swords can be forged and enough of the living unite, perhaps they may stand a chance.Can you remember Daenerys' vision she had in the House of the Undying? It was the one in which the Iron Throne was seen covered in snow, and the great walls reduced to rubble; I'm starting to fear that this is a very accurate glimpse into the future of Westeros. If all of the living do not band together - and quickly - then the dead will surely defeat all those we have grown to love and care for. Will Bran come to the rescue in the next season?Can Daenerys' dragons kill White Walkers?Will the High Sparrow have Loras, Margaery, and Cersei killed? Or will they confess their sins and perhaps gain a lighter sentence from the Gods?I cannot wait to find out. From what I've read so far, this seems to be the highest-rated episode of Game of Thrones to-date. I do not doubt that the final two episodes of this season will be as astounding as this episode, as they historically always are. This season may have started off slow, but I think we can all agree that this episode fundamentally alters any opinions we may have had before now. All in all, I am thoroughly pleased with this episode; however, I fear that the future may not be so pleasant..."
145," Hardhome
",10,True,"One of the best episodes of the series, the episode presented the Night King in a wonderful and terrifying way, and despite the destruction of his character in the eighth season, I deliberately watched the Thunderbolt and felt that humans have no chance against the Night King and the army of the living dead The Night King's revival of the dead was the best scene in the episode"
146," There are dead things in the water...
",10,True,"We open to the immediate aftermath of the Lion and the Dragon meeting in her throne room. Tyrion has always been known for dealing the hard truth and he does it here with great effect. It's the sort of logical cold fact which trumps the emotional insecurities and desires of Jorah; whatever he may plead, his devotion is built on a base of lies and betrayal. With one blow Tyrion becomes much more than a dwarf in rags to Dany while Jorah is once again exiled. But he will not resign himself to the ruins of Valyria and the Stone Men. Jorah the Andal's story is not yet over. Daznak's Pit awaits. After no sign of Arya last week we see a sudden jump in her storyline. She is ready to become someone else, something else. And how lively are the markets of Braavos! At last we get to step through the bustle and hubbub of the harbour- side as the score jumps up and down and suggests a living breathing world instead of a filming set. It's brilliantly inter-cut with the voice-over and the recitation of Arya and her master as she ascends to the new role of the oyster seller. The music turns ominous as she finally is granted her first mission of assassination. There's a vast array of fine acting performances throughout this episode, even in the smaller story lines. In a dank dungeon a withered and beaten Cersei cries for any assistance at all. It's often forgotten but Lena Headey becomes Cersei so effortlessly through all the scorn and contempt that is visible in her facial expressions. Her reign is at it's end, a different women from the prideful queen. In Winterfell, a tense confrontation between a Sansa that vocalises her frustrations and fears more-so than the entire season and a broken Reek who manages to let slip one confession. A silhouette of two beaten and defeated characters, one with the facade of strength, standing tall and visibly emotional after hearing a tiny glimpse of hope, the first in months. The other, still frightened and brainwashed. How easy it is to forget the acting. But the real objective is Hardhome. Hardhome, the title of the episode. The vast and expansive frozen land on which the wildlings have made camp. It's a very impressive setting as the boats row in, matching the rhythm of the slow tense beats of the bass drum. It's so satisfying to hear the words that come out of Jon and Tormund's mouths. The undeniable grains of truth are that the White Walkers are coming and only behind the Wall will there be safety. Jon's goodwill and Tormund's rationality shine through with each breath. Yet the world of Westeros is not one of logic and rationality. Thousands of years of separation and hostility exist in the blood of the wildlings and not all of them can shake hands with a crow. There are bigger dangers out there however. First the howls of dogs, always a sure sign of bad things to come. Then an eyeball poking out of a gap, wondering... It's great how they didn't resort to a jump- scare here and it makes the reveal all the more effective. A few cries, screams, the hint of bodies moving... It's without a doubt the best large scale battle of the entire series so far. Of course the Battle at the Wall was a spectacle, but here there is the first real sense of urgency, fear and panic in the air. The visual effects for each of the wights are at once more cost effective than the battle near the cave that Bran and co. fought through last season. The shaky cam is perhaps a bit excessive and at some moments the zoom is too close to really tell what is going on, but it's exactly the sort of chaos and frenzy that the scene needs. There's a significant longer take in between the frenetic editing, where Jon sprints through the battlefield, hacks a few wights and makes his way over to the hut with the dragon-glass only for a giant to rip through the roof with a bellow, skeletons hanging onto his back. He rips them off and stamps them dead with his foot with such ferocity and the camera angle is just perfect that it really showcases his might and size along with the excellent sound design of his roars and his massive foot hitting the ground.That's perhaps not even the most menacing part of the episode. The four horsemen emerge from the mists with only brief outlines visible but even that is enough to tell us what we are dealing with. We get a much closer look as Jon attempts to hold one off while searching for the vital dragon-glass. The costuming and makeup are icy cold and completely frightening. You feel as if they are completely alien and possess a deadly danger beyond what Westeros have ever seen. All without speaking a single word. There's the icy figures of dead children unborn as the wildling chieftainess (Birgitte Hjort Sørensen making her debut and possible exit) struggles to hod back over the stuttering score which is reminiscent of a horror movie's soundtrack. But here it works because this is unlike anything they have ever witnessed. A medieval setting with a few hints of fiery dragons and dark magic, and north, far far north, the biggest threat the continent awaits. Similarly to the ending of the Red Wedding, the credits are soft. The icy water laps up against the shore where dead comrades, sons, daughters, fathers, mothers all breath new life. What an utterly exhilarating and fantastic episode of Game of Thrones that was. I only hope it will be topped by the 9th or the finale as tradition states. 10/10"
147," You guys still hate D&D?
",10,True,"Well, it sucks that a lot of people stopped watching after episode 6, because this episode was freaking amazing. The first half hour spent time focusing on its characters, and everyone finally got to see Tyrion and Daenerys's paths cross over. But the highlight of the episode was definitely the battle that was extremely unexpected. Winter has finally come, and the White Walkers came with it. Also, this season has successfully built up to possibly one of the most violent battles of the series. Although there are many memorable episodes, this one will obviously be one of them.I'm hoping that the last two episodes will be a hell of a ride like the books"
148," Review of season 5: Episodes 7-8
",10,True,"Greetings from Lithuania.Episode 7 was good, not great, but good. There were some plot developments as usual, plot moves forward, but nothing that good. Sure, costumer, set design, acting is at their best, but something was missing. Episode 8 gave us FINALLY that missing piece. WOW was the first word that came to my mind after witnessing this piece of art. Won't going to spoil anything, but this is hands down the best episode of season 5, and one of the very best of the entire show - it is THAT good. There were many great written exchanges in this episode, very strong acting us usual, and what an outcome. Sure, it's not the outcome yet, but what a spectacular, superbly directed, shoot sequence at the end. Kudos to all involved, terrific sequence, probably to big to wittiness it on a small screen - what other shows do something like that?Overall, Episode 7 gets 8/10, and Episode 8 pure 10/10. ""I think we are fxxxed"" - that is probably was the first thought that came to John Snow's mind at the very end of this sequence."
149," The Increasing Army of Wights and White Walkers
",10,True,"Tyrion convinces Daenerys to become her adviser and she spares Johar, banishing him from Meereen. In king's Landing, Cercei refuses to confess and is informed that the High Sparrow has a strong case against her. In Braavos, Arya is assigned to pose as seller of oyster to spy a gambler. In Winterfell, Theon discloses to Sansa that Ramsay has mutilated him and also that he has not killed her two brothers Bran and Rickon. Ramsey tries to convince his father to attack Stannis. Jon Snow and Tormund meet the Wildlings in their village and try to convince them to move to Castle Black, but only 5,000 of them accept the offer and embark in the ships. Out of the blue, they are attacked by the wights and White Walkers. ""Hardhome"" is probably the best episode of ""Game of Thrones"" so far with an unforgettable and exciting battle. All the segments are important and interesting but the fight between the Wildlings and the Night's Watch against the wights and the White Walkers is the best sequence ever. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): Hardhome"
150," Well....What can i say now.....WINTER IS COMING !!
",10,True,"well..i don't know were to begin. I mean the is one of the finest hour of television that i have witnessed until now. i don't know what people say about season 5 being the least best among all the seasons, but i can surely tell you that all the starting episodes were made for the character development and for a great build up which has finally paid of in this episode. I cant call it just an episode because it was an experience. The best thing in the episode was the long stare between the walker leader and Jon snow, i mean it was one of the most intense scenes one could witness in their whole lives. those who have not watched the episode and is reading my review , i can assure you one thing, IT WILL BE THE GREATEST HOUR YOU WOULD HAVE EVER SPENT WATCHING TELEVISION AND I MEAN IT."
151," Best Episode Ever?
",10,True,"Is this the best episode of Game of Thrones ever? So far shock value has been the cause of a lot of positive reviews in episodes that were, OK, but not great.This episode however is not like that, it doesn't rely on shock or surprise, it is well written, well put together and for me the best episode of the season by a long way. Possibly too, of the entire GOT show.I am SOIAF book reader, and I know that this series has been, (mostly) way off the events that are portrayed in the books, but many key elements are in place on this episode, such as Arya's development, Cercei's story, and the re-emergence of the real enemy.I love the additions to the storyline that develop with this episode, it is both very entertaining, and very intuitive of the TV writers. Hats off to them.So to conclude, this may well be the best episode or GOT so far, along with, (in my opinion), 'The The Rains of Castamere' and 'Blackwater' Watch it, and decide for yourselves."
152," Felt like a real Game of Thrones episode.. FINALLY!
",10,True,"Excellent episode.. Loved how Jon Snow finally meets the White Walkers and the Night's King. Personally, I believe that the Sand Snakes were the worst bit of this season and since they were not in this episode, the episode was amazing :P Cersei finally got what she deserved and the new side of Arya was interesting to watch. The Sansa scene was alright, but viewers do have to admit, you need bouts of boredom to truly enjoy the best surprises of a show. I do not understand how a few people rate it less than a solid 10. The fact that WINTER HAS COME is alone to bring chills to the minds of the viewers. If some people think that nudity or death of a major character has to make an episode outstanding, I think they need some psychological help."
153," The thirst for salvation and the everlasting hunger.
",10,True,"This episode may very well be the best of the season, capturing the major characters as they are at most private moment or facing grave predicament. Arya has begun her training, which is actually an exercise in medieval espionage. The girl dons new name and outfits, then the girl pretends. The relationship with her enigmatic mentor is highly unconventional, yet Arya seems content. This is strangely one of her happier times.Meanwhile the matriarchs of the kingdoms have much different fates. Cersei doesn't face her incarceration well, she must lower herself to the man he gave power to. While the prospect of humility sickens her, the need for survival might be enough to overcome that. Daenerys has much better luck as she meets with the wise Tyrion. The two have a very good chemistry, this encounter is long overdue, and it turns out to be a pleasant one. The same cannot be said for Jorah who still longs for the every so distant affection.The best comes at the second half as Jon Snow ventures deep into hostile territory. Icy village of the Wildlings is nothing short of breathtaking. Mix of winter landscape and isolated settlement make for an amazingly cool visual. Negotiation goes as expected, stern opposition from most, a touch of violence and reasonable few willing to hear his plea for mutual survival. It all changes when the White Walker nation attacks.Tyrion and Daenerys are not the only ones having fateful meeting. The elusive White Walkers make their presences known as they storm Jon Snow and the Wildlings like a plague. With excellent choreography and special effects, the skirmish has the production value any feature length movie would envy. Each scene is as fascinating and engaging than the last, culminating in intense physical and tearful emotional struggle.This is Game of Thrones as its peak, and quite possibly the best presentation any TV show could hope to offer."
154," Probably the best episode of the series
",10,True,"Game of Thrones deals with a massive cast and crew and the story line has widened so much in the past few years that even they cannot show everybody in one episode. But this episode deals with everyone of significant importance, like Daenerys, Arya, Cercei, Sansa and Jon Snow, of course. Nowadays it is very rare to all of them in a single episode, so score on that account.Also from the story's point of view it had some big changes and the story line of some characters changed after this episode. Like Arya starts her training to be a faceless men. Cercei's character changed completely, we know the cercei who used to always threaten people, but now in this episode she can be seen licking water from the floor. Tyrion comes on the winning side finally(sorry, that's just how i feel, big daenerys targaryen fan, can't help it). Theon finally tells Sansa, that he never murdered Bran and Rickon, and now i think he might finally start helping her.Awesome character development, i have to give them that. Cercei for instance, from the most powerful person to a helpless prisoner. These sorts of things can only happen at GOT....And now finally the things that happened at Hardhome. White Walkers..... I was hoping for a fight with the walkers, but didn't thought to see it in this season. Definitely, i have to say that i was surprised and shocked. In the scene where everyone at Hardhome starts to run and there is a big chaos and the shot is taken in such a way that we are not able to see what is actually happening at that time. I thought that there was an avalanche but as soon as i realized that it was the Wights and Others, my reaction was like, oh god, White Walkers, now they are definitely dead.Best Direction, Best Direction of Photography, and all the CGI they put in that scene it as absolutely amazing. Hardhome was shown very artfully, although it was quite different from as described in the books. All the fights choreographed nicely... And man, how do they make the White Walkers look so awesome. All in all, that was some serious stuff that happened in this episode. By far the best episode of GOT...Respect + Love +"
155," Hardhome
",10,True,Definitely one of the best battles from the worst season
156," night king
",10,True,One of the best things ever shown on tv!no need to say more!
157," The best episode of the season- if not of the show
",10,True,"""Stark, Baratheon,Lannister,Targaryen,Tyrell, they're all just spikes in a wheel"" This week's episode was one of the most intriguing, shocking and most of all exciting episodes of this season. We begin with Arya (no one) during her training to become an assassin, and we can already see that she does no longer refer to herself as Arya, making us believe she truly is going to become an assassin. Then we see Cercei degrading herself for some water on the floor, this for me truly showed some kind of poetic justice, for all the lives she's both taken and ruined. Later we see Tyrion and Dany discussing plans for the first time, I can just imagine what plans they have for the future of the seven kingdoms, but the question remains: Will Dany be like her father when given Westeros? And lastly, we get to the jewel of the episode, the battle of Hardhome. At first I thought the Thens would go revolutionary against the free folk for joining the Night's Watch, but then we see the mist... and what comes with it. This battle showed us how this series still has potential for the future, for it showed us what will happen if the White Walkers are not stopped. Lastly, I want to congratulate the writers for this episode that revived the pace of the show by giving us a true masterpiece. Keep it up, Game of Thrones!"
158," Winter Has Finally Come
",10,True,"In what is arguably one of the greatest episodes of the show so far, winter has finally arrived, and in a way that nobody would've expected. Up there with the likes of the Rains of Castamere and Blackwater, Hardhome may have a heavy use of CGI, but it is not to the detriment of its epic atmosphere and unprecedented revelation. No doubt, viewers will be talking about this one for a while, and with good reason.Starting in King's Landing, it's a vast satisfying moment to see Cersei locked in a cell that she ironically put herself in. Even more satisfying is watching her being hit with a spoon by the Septa Unella who is constantly demanding her confession. It's now at the point where even Qyburn is imploring that she confess, but Cersei has so much self-centered pride that she will never concede defeat. Watching her slurp the spilled water from her cell floor is pleasing to see, and is symbolic of her almighty downfall.Across the Narrow Sea in Braavos, Arya is finally learning the ways of serving the Many-Faced God, and sporting a new outfit, she's looking like the Arya we once new with a gratifying confidence that absolutely makes her character unique. The Waif continues to doubt her, but Jaqen is willing to go ahead. Her job is unclear so far, but her ultimate path to conquer the world of lying has taken a great step in the right direction.In Meereen, a new alliance has begun which could change the fabric of Game of Thrones forever. Daenerys, Tyrion and Jorah all contribute to some well-acted sequences that are taking some interesting turns. Despite his banishment, Jorah continues to show his loyalty to Danerys, even ignoring his own mortality to do it, and this could lead to another nail-biting moment in the next episode. Both Peter Dinklage and Emilia Clarke act there socks off in what is a superior dialogue scene where very important details are being discussed. Eventually, and happily for us, Daenerys accepts Tyrion's offer to become her adviser.Briefly, in the North, we get that big chance to see Theon (or Reek) finally reveal that he had not killed Sansa's brothers. This could mean many things for the near future, but at the moment it means that Sansa can now start to understand Theon's terrible position. In addition, Roose Bolton is making his inevitable plans for war with Stannis, emphasising the defense of Winterfell itself. Ramsay has other ideas though, and it could men that soon he will take a group of Bolton soldiers to infiltrate Stannis' camp - now that could be interesting.Of course, the best moments came beyond the Wall in Hardhome, as something unbelievable gruesome and deadly unfolds. As I have already iterated, winter has finally come (the Starks are always right eventually), and the army of the dead with it. Karsi's character was wonderfully introduced, and then instantly taken away in what is one of the most terrifying sequences the show's given us up until now. Jon's fierce battle with the White Walker was beyond exciting, and that final moment as the dead rise again as wights, the Night's King shows just how powerful their army is, and things are looking very grim for the world now.A superb episode of two halves - one where the game of thrones continues to be played, albeit slowly, but very surely, and then the real horror is revealed as we finally realise that all these battles of king against king and lord against lord don't matter compared to what's coming beyond the Wall. If only more people had the same luck as Jon Snow.9.5/10"

160," Hardhome: Chills
",10,True,"As you can tell by it's nearly perfect rating, Hardhome might just be the best episode in one of the best series ever created.I won't go into details but I can still remember how amazing and chilling it was the first time I saw it. It's a roller-coaster ride that ends in a calm, chilling, omniscient way that felt amazing."
161," Season Five is probably among the show's very best ones. And Hardhome rocks!
",10,True,"Game of Thrones has become THE television fixation which people tend to really love or really hate. As for me, I reckon it's a medieval-European-influenced piece of fiction that's become a television tapestry of political commentary, genre-breaking television conventions, fantastic fight scenes and characters who have become household names comparable to the Star Wars and Harry Potter casts of characters: yet these guys have the intensity and evocation of tragic Shakespearean characters.Game of Thrones is blockbuster television done right, and Hardhome is one gigantic set-piece bursting with spectacle and character that has helped the show stay great."
162," Hard hitting home
",10,True,"Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.Although it seems to not be a popular opinion, actually liked Season 5 better than most fans. It was not perfect by any stretch, the Sand Snakes being a notable flaw and were the main drawback to the polarising but to me better than given credit for ""Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken"". There was also a lot to admire and love and personally liked to loved the previous episodes despite things taking a while to settle. While ""The Gift"" was the season's first truly outstanding episode, it is with ""Hardhome"" that sees 'Game of Thrones' in all its glory. ""Hardhome"" is not just the magnum opus of Season 5 even with two episodes left to go (the previous season magnum opuses being Season 1 with ""Baelor"", Season 2 with ""Blackwater"", Season 3 with ""The Rains of Castamere"" and Season 4 with ""The Laws of Gods of Men"" with a good case being made too for ""The Children""), but also one of the best episodes of the entire show.Plotlines and character development are advanced the most they were all season. There is a perfect balance of intricate character moments and drama, especially with Arya, the character of Karsi and showing signs of hope in increasingly dire straits. Similarly, there is a powerful mix of heart-wrenching poignancy, nail-biting intensity, shocking revelations and some of the show's most spectacular action that has emotional impact (exciting, terrifying and moving) and is more than just spectacle. The characters are all interesting and layered, and ""Hardhome"" boasts the sharpest script of Season 5, and one of the sharpest of the whole show, and the tightest pacing of all the fifth season episodes, anyone frustrated with the slow pace of the previous episodes (personally am not one of them) will be relieved.'Game of Thrones' always delivers on the acting. The casting is spot on and the performances are superb across the board, particularly from Peter Dinklage, Emilia Clarke, Maisie Williams and Birgitte Hjort Sorensen.Visually, ""Hardhome"" looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about ""Hardhome"" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.In conclusion, a fantastic episode that hits home hard. Anyone disappointed with the previous episodes, a lot were and again not one of them, will be thrilled with this. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
163," Under rated
",10,True,"This episode is like an injection loaded with the purest form of adrenaline. Starts off as a great episode then gets better and better. Ends on a fantastic note. The last 15 minutes at mereen are simply incredible and i would rate it as the best episode of the season (I've seen the finale). Hardhome was incredible but this is even better. The fighting scenes are perhaps the best I've seen till date,the brilliance of this show matches the grandeur of this show which is simply unbelievable. game of thrones is among the finest things in the history of mankind,its far ahead than other shows that we see today. Cant thank the makers of this show enough. It is so raw and feels so real,GOT is a whole new world in itself. This is insane stuff and television doesnot get any better than this. Im sure by now u have got my point.Lool"
164," THE DANCE OF DRAGONS. Arguably the best episode of the show's entire run.
",10,True,"The show's run of ninth episodes have been consistently excellent, either relying on a shocking and emotional character death or an elongated battle sequence. The Dance of Dragons, whose title is a play on the latest novel in George R.R. Martin's source material series, takes the two conventional episode nine structures and mashes them together, not unlike the ways in which Aegon and Rhaenyra Targaryen fought in the titular Dance of Dragons, set decades before the show's time frame. This historic battle provides the framework for the episodes two most notable scenes; Shireen's sacrifice and Dany's reopening of the fighting pits, both of which I'll get to later. There's bound to be controversy surrounding the former, a narrative twist I would like to immediately defend, but if the Game of Thrones following has any justice left, no-one will attack the events of the episode's closing sequence. Because that was just awesome.The Dance of Dragons hits its stride after we leave the Wall and Braavos and Dorne, as the episode's final half hour lies solely with Stannis and Dany. This episode saw Stannis suffer an attack from Ramsay and his men overnight, leading to him succumbing to Melisandre's cruel plan to sacrifice his daughter Shireen to the Lord of Light. This is unquestionably a horrific ordeal to watch, and director David Nutter's notion of filming the faces of those watching rather than the victim suffering isn't a far cry away from the framing of Sansa's rape back in episode six. It's already been proclaimed that this was entirely out of character, for Stannis to sacrifice and burn his own daughter at the stake, but I fail to believe this. Stannis was, after all, introduced as a man so insistent on taking the throne that he murdered his own (innocent) brother in cold blood, and willingly sent hundreds of men to their death after the wildfire explosion in Blackwater Bay. Every time Stannis has been backed into a corner, he has relied on and taken Melisandre's advice, and it is entirely justified that he would do so again, now that he's in his most difficult corner yet.Earlier in this season, Stannis and Shireen had a heartfelt moment in which Stannis told her the story of how he saved her from Greyscale, and proudly declared her as his daughter and someone whom he loves. Perhaps bis uneventful time the Wall softened viewers to Stannis, a man who, let's face it, has shown repeated signs of bordering on insanity. When placed in that context, it is Stannis and Shireen's nicer scene that feels more out of character than his sacrifice of her. The show rarely portrays Stannis in a positive light (there isn't much there to portray, after all), and for him to burn his own daughter at the stake feels entirely true to both his character and his motives, as difficult as it is to watch. And that it is, I'd place this only a fraction below the emotional weight of the infamous Red Wedding, this time two seasons ago. We knew what Stannis planned as soon as he sent Davos away, so for Shireen to unknowingly offer herself up for the sacrifice was a heartbreaking scene, followed only by her sudden realisation and ultimate demise. Screaming for her parents whilst she burns alive, Kerry Ingram (Shireen) gave the performance of the season in the show's most emotionally devastating sequence in years; a moment that will not be forgotten easily.But it is followed by a sequence that, whilst far from the emotional weight of Shireen's death, is arguably the most intense fight the show has offered. And this is coming just one week after Hardhome, which, despite being the larger and more surprising fight, didn't have anywhere near as much at stake. After Jorah won his battle in the fighting pits, he throws a spear directly towards Dany, only for it to impale an incoming Son of the Harpy warrior. This immediately escalates into a full blown fight, with Dany and her company stranded in the middle of the arena, surrounded by attackers. As Dany takes Missandei's hand (the shot that stuck in my mind the most), she closes her eyes, and then we hear it. Dany and Drogon's relationship has been rocky for a while now, but it only seems right that he would come to save her in her most dire moment. Drogon fends off the attackers while taking a few spears himself, but when Dany approaches him he screeches at her. This was the moment that both Dany and the viewer understood the same thing; if she doesn't get him out of there, he will kill everyone, including the likes of Tyrion, Jorah, and Missandei. In what I can only describe as the most breathtaking moment of the entire show, Dany climbs atop of Drogon and leads him to the sky.And, for some reason, I found this really emotionally affecting. Dany has been my favourite character in this show for quite some time now, and to see her and Drogon together in such a way hit me harder than I imagined it would. They fly off together, leaving her company (and the audience) stood in awe at what they've just seen. This has been a slow season for Game of Thrones, but it was needed after the bloodbath that was season four. Every ounce of character work and narrative setup has led to this episode, and it exceeded any expectation I had of it. Every now and then, a television episode comes along that is all entertaining, thrilling, emotional and shocking. The Dance of Dragons managed this seamlessly, delivering the best hour of television so far this year."
165," The Sons of the Harpy attack
",10,True,As this episode opens Stannis's camp is attacked by a small force lead by Ramsey Bolton; important stocks and vital horses are destroyed and the attackers departed before anybody knows what is happening. This leads Stannis to order Davos Seaworth back to Castle Black to get further supplies; with him away Stannis does what Melisandre has demanded and makes a shocking sacrifice. Further north Jon and the Wildlings get to Castle Black and are relieved when the gate is opened. At the other end of Westeros Jaime Lannister meets Doran Martell and negotiates to take Myrcella back to King's Landing.Across the Narrow Sea in Essos Arya sets off to assassinate the 'thin man'; as she nears him she is distracted by the arrival of a boat carrying Mace Tyrell and more importantly Meryn Trant. She neglects her mission and follows Trant to a local brothel; she doesn't act against him but learns that he will be back the next day. In Meereen it is time for the Games where combatants fight to the death in the fighting pits. One of those fighting is Jorah Mormont who is determined to show his loyalty to Daenerys. As the fight ends The Sons of the Harpy attack spectators and move to kill Daenerys; she and a small group are surrounded in the middle of the pit when salvation comes in the form of one of her dragons.So far each 'episode nine' has either featured the surprising death of major characters or a battle that takes up the entire episode; this episode doesn't fit that pattern but it is still one of the most gripping as it frequently looks as though major characters are in real danger. This isn't to say that no recurring characters die; the death of Shireen Baratheon was one of the most surprising and disturbing deaths to date even though she was a relatively minor character. Arya's scenes were also fairly tense even though it never felt as though she would come to real harm. The highlight of the episode was of course the action in Meereen; this was exciting. This is especially true once the Sons of the Harpy attack even though I suspect many viewers will have expected a dragon to come to Daenerys's rescue it is still great when it appears. Overall a gripping episode that left me looking forward to the series finale.

",10,True,"Now this episode is going to shake the internet!!! there is so much happening in this episode I don't really now what my feelings are, I'm honestly sad, excited, and scared of what is going to happen next. Many book readers don't like that D&D changed some story lines, but I'm really grateful they did as they changed the show to the better. Arya never meets ser Meryn Trant, nor Daenerys is directly attacked by the sons of harpy, and oh my god,they just killed two more characters that are still alive in books.... I don't want to spoil who for those who still didn't watch the episode... Overall, this was a hell of an episode that you don't want to miss!"
167," Fire and Ice.
",10,True,"Well, having just watched the episode I am still processing the things I saw. The episode certainly delivered scenes that evoked a lot of emotion - both sadness and elation to the degree few other shows can. Some will be mad as usual about the harshness of the storyline. *Spoilers follow for the episode so don't read if you haven't seen it*The episode primarily consisted of Stannis' choice in the north and Dany's arc. It developed Arya's arc which is leading hopefully to her confrontation of someone on her infamous list. The Dorne players made peace - setting up for the future. The first main storyline was the betrayal of Shireen Baratheon by her parents to the witch Melisandre. Though I was hoping against hope that Stannis' love for his daughter would win over his desperation - this was not the case. Those who claim this is inconsistency in his character though have viewed him with rose colored glasses. Let us not forget he had his brother Renly killed the last time he was at a critical juncture and sadly enough, his familial love once again lost out to his ""destiny"" and ambition. Stannis is brave and tough as Blackwater exhibited but those who ever thought he was a ""all round good guy"" were deluding themselves. He killed his brother and now he killed his daughter. I was never Team Stannis but still wonder how his ""destiny"" plays out and will look forward to seeing what develops. His wife redeemed herself slightly in this instance but still had let her brother burn in the beginning of season 2 so hardly an innocent either. Melisandre is well Melisandre - lives are just pieces on her board. I am sad for Shireen and Stannis is going to lose the good people that believed in him. Certainly Davos is going to be heartbroken.Now when Stannis clashes with the Boltons - I can only hope that Littlefinger wins (following his plan to swoop in at the end and defeat the weakened winnder) - lol saying a lot that Littlefinger is the one that I clearly root for in the battle of Winterfell!Dany's arc was suspenseful and glorious. At first I worried that there was no way I would be able to watch it after the horrible thing that happened with Stannis but the interactions of her companions quickly captured my attention. I am glad to see Jorah redeem himself (though his time is limited by his disease) and the image of Drogon flying in and defending Dany was marvelous as was her mounting him for the first time. Tyrion and Dany's mercenary boytoy were both in excellent witty form. There are going to be repercussions for the Sons of the Harpy and it was good to see some of them burn by dragon fire. We will see what happens next episode.In the end, the episode had both great sadness, suspense, and awe- inspiring imagery in the colliseum. As usual Thrones did not play it safe and many will as usual threaten ""rage-quits"" though at this stage honestly it sounds hollow - if you've been watching this long, you don't want your drama to take the safe route - you want it to push the boundaries and this is what GoT does. Sometimes you'll love it and sometimes you will be angry and heartbroken - don't pretend you don't know this by now."
168," Sheer Perfection
",10,True,"I didn't think they'd be able to match the quality of last week's episode ""Hardhome"", but here we are! ""The Dance of Dragons"" is without a doubt one of the most suspenseful and shocking episodes we've had so far - for a multitude of reasons...Firstly, I was surprised that Ramsay Bolton's ""attack"" on Stannis was over in under sixty seconds, and that we didn't actually see him or his twenty men, however it set up a decision for later on in the episode which I understand some took to disagreeing with.Jon Snow lets the Wildings through Castle Black and Ollie shoots him a nasty look - what is he planning? I fear that all of Jon's hard work may quickly be undermined by this young boy and his hatred for those who butchered his family.Arya's storyline is much more interesting in this episode as she's torn between her desire to become no-one and to please the Many-Faced-God, yet she's also oh-so-eager to cross some names off that wonderful little list of hers. I'm interested to see what her final decision will be: stick to her given task or go off and get her revenge.And what of Stannis' storyline? Well, I can't say his decision surprised me. Stannis has victory and the Iron Throne on his mind, and he will stop at nothing to get what he sees his destiny to be - as this episode clearly evidences. He sacrifices his own daughter Shireen to the Lord of Light in order to aid his war efforts and take Winterfell from the Boltons. I have to ask: were some people honestly surprised by this? Have you been paying any attention at all? This is Game of Thrones - nobody is safe:""If you think this has a happy ending, you haven't been paying attention.""Stannis murdered his own brother back in season two, sent thousands to their deaths in the Battle of Blackwater, forced his men to march on Winterfell despite the imminence of winter, and he even cut off the fingers of Davos! Surely nobody could possibly be surprised that he would sacrifice his own daughter? Especially since Melisandre repeatedly proves that her visions are true and the Lord of Light is powerful. Stannis is undoubtedly one of the most ruthless men in Westeros, so if you thought this was out of character for him, either start paying more attention or just stop watching altogether.The Fighting Pits: Daenerys, Jorah the explorah, Tyrion, The Sons of the Harpy, and Drogon. What more could you want? The duel with Jorah was exhilarating to watch. I truly thought for a second that Daenerys would stop the fight and have Jorah saved. I also thought that if she didn't intervene Jorah would surely die. I was wrong on both accounts: Jorah wins and expertly (and startlingly, I might add) throws a spear and kills a Son of the Harpy getting too-close-for-comfort to Daenerys. At this point, the Sons of the Harpy reveal themselves and the horror unfolds; the panic sets in and the bloodshed begins. It seemed hopeless for Daenerys and her allies, trapped in the middle of the pit, surrounded by far too many foes for them to take alone. And just when it was almost over, when she closed her eyes and held hands with Missandei, the electrifying screech of Drogon echoes and our hearts skip a beat. He comes to the rescue and sends the Sons of the Harpy running with flames at their feet. And then we are rewarded with something I never thought we'd see - Daenerys riding Drogon. I never thought she'd ever be able to, or would, but she did. And boy was that perfect. She truly is the Mother of Dragons - although that being said, at this point it seems appropriate for her to free Viserion and Rhaegal (her other two dragons, currently chained up) after this very close call.After what was a very gradual build-up for this season, I feel that it has paid off superbly considering last week's ""Hardhome"" and this week's episode. In addition, we didn't get any of King's Landing this week, which means we have that to look forward to next week in the season finale. And with all the tension building in King's Landing, this could make for the best season finale we've ever had in Game of Thrones."
169," The paths revealed by flame
",10,True,"As his efforts produced mixed results, Jon Snow tiredly returns to his castle, bringing hordes of equally weary survivors of White Walkers attack. Unbeknownst to him, The North has not seen the last of the fallen. In what may be the most vicious sacrifice in the show, and a strange contrast to Stannis' previously shown nature, he decides to trade his daughter for the promise of victory.There have been many deaths in the show, most are quick yet excruciating, but not Shireen's. Hers is through and through heart-wrenching. Her scream for parent's rescue fuels the agony even more.On the warmer side of the world, Jaime and Bronn unexpectedly get a more reasonable result on their political visit. Using actual politic maneuvering as well as a bit of luck, they manage to keep peace and their lives intact. There's lots of peculiar coalition between the two houses. It may just turn out well, after all there's bound to be one wedding where no one dies.Arya continues to perform her espionage duty as undercover merchant. Fate gives her a different path when she sees a familiar face, she follows this path to a brothel, of all places. If one unfortunate fate for a little girl isn't enough, there's an overwhelming hint of her exposed to a man's unusual appetite. This is a very uneasy development, really hoping she makes it through one more episode, with every bit of her unbroken.For the large skirmish on the snow before, this episode concludes with high octane battle on Daenerys' side. In a very entertaining gladiatorial game of death which then escalates into full blown riot, every character is involved in the intense survival. Honestly, the next scene could be the last of any character, the tension is genuine.It culminates in a mix of excellent choreography and visual effect. The show soars with sheer production value and its larger than life personalities."
170," An emotional and compelling episode that made me feel a bit sad
",10,True,"The Dance of Dragons is not only another classic episode, but it felt more emotional and compelling and it made me feel a bit sad. Mostly because of the choice Stannis made when he choose to sacrifice Shireen Baratheon, a sweet and innocent girl. I've heard that it polarized critics and fans of the books. Some liked it for it's strong character development while others hated it for betraying Stannis' character after the past few seasons. Anyway, everything else is so compelling.The characters are still believable, the story/script is well-written this time around, the action is great especially the end of the movie where Daenerys flies on her dragon which takes your breath away and the music score from Ramin Djawadi suited really well. The pacing is great and doesn't drag, the directing is great, the scenery/set/costumes are still gorgeous to look at, and the performances are still great. So, overall, another classic episode that is emotional and compelling. :)"
171," Either Or
",8,True,"I'm reading reviews that are all over the place. Apparently, some feel there are set of rules that can't be crossed. These folks should have stopped watching long ago. The series has pushed the envelope time after time after time. There's incest, sexual excess, nudity, graphic violence, on and on. The Game of Thrones is about power and the effects of power. When the little girl gets burned, many think the series has gone to far. It doesn't matter that numerous children have died in other episodes. What about the farm children that are the focus of Theon? This is a fiction and it's often about the worst of humanity. It's about every level of ambition possible. It is about people that see life as nothing, unless it's their own, and even then it's not valued. There are great scenes here. The final battle is quite amazing. Let's look at this series for what it is and stop imposing our own belief system on it. If you have very conservative views on this, it shouldn't be your cup of tea. I know that ""it is what it is"" is a cliché these days, but nothing is more apt. Also, quit comparing everything in the books to the film. Everyone knows that every adaptation that has been done is different from the final result. Hail ""King of Thrones"" for being honest and incredibly entertaining. I can't wait for the finale of Season 5."
172," Great episode
",10,True,"I know I will get a lot of hate because I said it was great, and many of these people will be book readers. First off, the Game of Thrones producers and writers never write something that George Martin doesn't agree with. After all they are his books and his ideas and plot lines. Secondly, George Martin himself said he intended to write more in ADWD when it was published, and the material in the book wasn't enough, so I'm guessing that we will start the sixth book with information that we already saw in the last few episodes in season 5. (I'm just guessing, don't eat me) In my opinion the episode was great and a little heartbreaking. We see a side of Stannis that we may have seen before but never to this extreme. I still can not get over his daughter's screams and cries for help, and the tears in his ""crazy"" wife's eyes as she watches her daughter burn to death. This scene was so intense, it may not have been in the books, but I don't think that the writers would take such a huge step without informing George about it, so I guess Martin was fine with this idea. This episode kind of showed us that Stannis is really dependent on the Lord of Light or whatever that is. I was always on his side and thought he will actually win the throne, but he seems to be way too dependent on this Lord of his. The most amazing scene out of all was the fighting pits. Jorah is one of the contestants and he wins(what a surprise.) Later, a rebellion, or you can call it a massacre occurs where they kill many of the people watching and they try to get to Dany. Dany and her unsullied become trapped and surrounded. Dany closes her eyes in a brief moment (I honestly thought she was getting ready to die) and out of nowhere comes our hero, Drogon! It was very interesting to watch Drogon actually involved in a fight. Dany then gets close to him and rides him for the very first time. It was very very fascinating to watch. I have really been waiting for this moment a long time. However, the dragon seemed a little bit weak when they started to attack him, for a moment I felt like he will pass out. I really hope they make the dragons stronger and bigger by next season. Really good episode overall! Can't wait for the finale."

174," It Was Worth It?
",10,True,"The most disturbing thing about this episode is Stannis burning her daughter alive for what he believes is the greater good, justifying himself with ""If a man knows what he is and remains true to himself, the choice is not choice at all. He must fulfill his destiny and become who he is meant to be, however much he hate it."" He believes he is the one true king and the one above the rest as a man with a great destiny upon him and with god backing him off. He will probably get disappointed after his god is a demon after all and all his plans are ruined. He will really regret doing the thing he did. At least the other players believe in themselves and not in some god that ask you to kill your daughter. And the mom regretted killing her own daughter at the last moment, she worried about her at the last correct moment. When all he did before was despising her."

I don't even know what else to say. The only reason I'm still typing is because reviews require ten lines to be submitted.

177," The Disappointing Fall of Thrones.......
",4,False,"This latest episode will doubtless cause polarization among GOT viewers. On the one hand, the final outcome of the story, or rather guessing which characters will and won't survive, has become ever more defined (one could read predictable), and like the previous episode 'Hardhome' was packed with drawn out, epic-ish action sequences (they came off as Ridley Scott rip off moments). However for those who count themselves fans of tension, suspense and clever plot lines, 'The Dance of Dragons' has fallen miserably short of the show's standard.As pointed out in other negative reviews, there are some serious continuity issues in the way the story is unfolding. The wildling party were traveling by ship, not by foot. The ease of the raid on Stannis's camp cannot be explained away by ""either the guards were asleep or complicit"", the sacrifice comes out of nowhere, with no buildup or rationale whatsoever, and the events at the arena of Meereen are largely both laughable and cringe worthy at the same time. For instance; that no one notices that half the audience has smuggled weapons and clearly identifiable masks, that the sons of the harpy not once press their advantage despite clearly outnumbering their prey by a wide margin, and that on every possible occasion they simply forget to target the Queen... As if you'd chuck the spear at the dragon if you could instead pierce your unarmoured, unprotected mortal enemy as she's starstruck not more than a few meters away (or that you let her climb on top of the beast, of course she's going to fly away!).Not to mention Sir Jorah's incredibly illogical survival (why dishonorably kill one rival only to let the other one get up and pick up his sword? Either he should of ruthlessly killed both of them there and then or let them finish each other off and take on the victor for the sake of grandstanding). I have to make this clear, Its not that I disagree with the outcomes of this episode, but the manner in which GOT has set itself up for the last episode of the season simply comes off as rushed, and robbed the audience of some great moments; such as a debate among the nightwatch pertaining to admitting the wildlings within the wall, a medieval black ops moment in the form of a menacing and cunning character we all love to hate (Ramsay Bolton) laying waste to the Barrathon camp, Stannis explaining to his men why he need burn his daughter, Sir Jorah proving his mettle rather than getting lucky and a moment where Daenerys actually has to make a choice to overcome her fear of her dragons or abandon her friends and loved ones, rather than being stupidly star struck and then deciding to take a fanciful flight in the middle of a blood bath.All in all, the episode choose thrills over sense, and even though I suspect the final installment of the season will attempt and may even succeed in explaining away some of the issues I and others have raised in objection, Im left with a bitter taste in the back of my throat. What's more the only acting to be celebrated in the entirety of the episode, is the absolute shock displayed by Stannis's daughter at her father's betrayal, in a moving, yet totally misplaced scene. GOT rose through the rankings of shows because, it was not a conventional crowd pleaser, it didn't offer un-original moments based on CGI, but rather it made the hard decisions and planned it shocks and thrills. To use a metaphor as a final statement; over the last two episodes, it is as if we have watched a genuine master swordsman with honor and flair, suddenly become a drunken, purposeless pub brawler in a shiny new outfit, cheap silicon sparkles and all."
178," No boundaries and overwhelming
",10,True,"This episode shakes things up and about.Once again, I couldn't believe what was about to happen, and it happened. And then some more.Personally I don't mind alterations from the books, if that benefits the series. Especially if it helps break expectations.""Oh no, they won't. Something will happen and it will be OK.""""Nope. What did just happen?""And in the middle of finding your comfort, they stack some more on top of you in awesome fashion. This episode was overwhelming.It's 10/10."
179," Treacherous, extremely sloppy, with gaping holes
",2,False,"Changes in the books have so far often been necessary, and usually made sense in the context of the series, even if it was for reasons that didn't have to do entirely with storytelling. Even incomprehensible cuts like lady Stoneheart could be tolerated. But in The Dance of Dragons Benioff and Weiss have not just gone too far, but have done so in such careless manner that it's hard to decide whether to be angry at them or mock them.I'll not focus too much on the utter betrayal of the character of Stannis. Let's start at the beginning of the episode, where Ramsay Snow takes the role of Vlad Tepes and does the show's version of the Night Attack. Convincing no one of how exactly he did this (generic excuse didn't really do the job), he sets the stage for a sacrifice that epitomises the writer's understanding of a twist: X says one thing, then does the opposite. Now, if you've read the book you know the potential for Shireen's sacrifice is there - except she's not with Stannis. And there are a trillion other potential targets for Melisandre first. Like Aemon, whom Jon sent away for that reason exactly. Or Mance Rayder, who...wait a minute, didn't they just burn him in the series too? And doesn't he have (according to Melisandre anyway) royal blood? Why, he does! But no one thought about that, because it would ruin our great idea (""GRRM kills likable characters, if we do the same, we'll be just as good"").The most obvious flaws of the episode however (as en episode, not an adaptation) are elsewhere: Jon's return to the Wall, leaving by ship, ending up on the wrong side of the gate, hundreds of miles from the shore, all for the sake of ONE DRAMATIC PAUSE before Ser Alliser lets them in. It's not a crime, but it shows the amount of thought our beloved storykillers put in this. Then we have the attack on Daenerys - with a bunch of characters around who shouldn't be there, Hizdahr Zo Loraq somehow innocent and dead, and a legion of assassins surrounding her extremely story-pampered grace (where's the ""let's put all those cholera infested poor people in the city"" bit? Wouldn't want her to look stupid, right?). The legion of assassins however, falls into a hallucinatory time vortex and reappear in a 1988 action movie, starring Steven Seagal. They are therefore forced to attack one at a time, slowly. Right after Jorah unlikely winning some duels because he fought poorly but no one killed him. (who'll win, the Meereenese or the Westerosi? Oh look, unlike the previous duel there are 4 more contesters who weren't announced).Lastly, we have the Arya story, which is fairly good, and Dorne. Where the sand snakes keep behaving like 4 year olds (seriously, their dialogue is uncharacteristically bad), and Doran Martel may at some point explain his designs to someone. It seems to me like they're just using this storyline as filling until they decide how to change it, probably for the worse.I'm not giving it 1 star because it's not bad TV. It's an objectively sloppily written episode and I think to a lot of people who love the books, especially us Stannis fans, it is an unforgivable, pointless and very poorly (if at all) justified betrayal of the original material."
180," Big letdown
",3,False,"So far, I think this is the low point of the entire show. From the beginning:1) Jon and the wildlings reappearing on the wrong side of the wall. Why did they get off the ships north of the wall? To march on foot in the snow, north of the wall, for half the length of the wall (with risk of being attacked again by white walkers? Really weird. The only explanation seems to be that they couldn't resist to the thrill of passing through the tunnel (preceeded by the disturbing doubt: would they open the gate?).2) Stannis/Shireen. The drama construction is rushed and rough. A father who leads his daughter to the pyre just saying ""forgive me"" is not a dramatic neither a tragic scene. It's just ridiculous. Poor, poor writing, poor character's evolution, only for the sake of shocking the audience.3) The Arya training is far less intriguing and exciting than Karate Kid. No complexity, no content, no challenge. Just boring. Just a curiosity: is the faceless god church perfectly legal in Braavos? It must be so, since it's definitely not hidden in the suburbs, it's a gigantic building, everyone knows where it is and that it's full of assassins, the assassins go back and forth without troubles. Is it a regular activity? Do they pay taxes to the city? Such a prominent presence in the daylight would ask at least for some better justification (after 8 episodes in Meereen, we still know nothing of Meereen, no interesting character, no plot whatsoever, just the boring presence of Jaqen). Season 1 of the show was definitely not in this sort of cartoonish style.4) All the situation in Meereen's arena was unbearably unlikely. Dozens, hundreds of people get to enter the stadium with daggers, spears, swords, even a golden mask hidden in the pants for each one! Without being noticed by anyone, with the queen in person standing among them. No security at all (though they know perfectly well of the existence of a vast subversive sect aimed to kill the queen)? Come on! That's beyond any likelihood, simply childish. All the scene is so poorly set up. When the queen and her men are surrounded and outnumbered, no one even tries to cast an arrow or a javelin towards her. The harpies seem just to wait for Drogon to arrive and burn them all, like anyone else. When Drogon is there, all the spears against him, no one towards Dany, who should be the target of the attack. A very poor choreography.In my opinion, the quality of the show is running downhill. Except for a couple of episodes (7 and 8), this fifth season is a complete letdown, but this in particular is actually the worst one."
181," Absolutely terrible, but not for the reasons you think
",1,False,"Fair warning, this is coming from the perspective of a book reader.Game of Thrones is often criticized for having scenes just for shock value. I have never agreed with this, because no matter how brutal the show is, what happens always makes sense in the context of the characters and their decisions. The Red Wedding, Sansa's deflowering, and so on have all made sense in the context of the characters.Stannis burning Shireen makes absolutely no sense. The violence didn't bother me. If it made sense within the context of his character and his situation...but it doesn't. The character of Stannis doesn't make any sense anymore on the show.""Stannis doesn't change his mind"" they say. Just last episode he was refusing to do it! Even in the show, it's made clear that he is an excellent commander and a hard man. This is the guy who held Storm's End for more than a year with no food. You mean to tell me that he decides to burn his only daughter (AND HEIR) alive after a few tents get burned by Mr. Plot-Armor-Ramsey? He refused to burn Gendry (or Edric, if you're a book reader) but suddenly decides to burn his own daughter? It makes even less sense when you consider his current position in this war. Davos is his most loyal follower and best asset - there's no way he follows Stannis after this. Jon will likely not follow him either. Stannis has no heir now, and the chances of him getting another one are basically zilch. By burning his only daughter and heir he has just ensured that he will NEVER take the Iron Throne.Finally, the entire battle with Dany makes no sense either. Unsullied are supposed to be the best soldiers and guards in the entire world, yet a bunch of scrubs in mask manage to get right up to Dany without being noticed? Game of Thrones is an excellent story. I think that at this point, D&D are stretching things to their absolute limits in order to maneuver characters and advance the story, at the expense of the integrity of the characters and their motivations. I gave them a lot of slack considering the budget and the time limits they work with, but after this episode the show is off the rails. I don't know where they are going next with this now that they have totally destroyed Stannis as a character, but in my mind this show is not telling the story of A Song of Ice and Fire anymore."
182," this show should be better than stooping to cheap shock value
",3,False,"I have to say that in a twisted way I am impressed with the writers of this show, because they have achieved something I have never before witnessed. I'm about as jaded a movie/TV watcher as you'll find. Torture porn, extreme gore, you name it. I've seen it all. Some of it disturbs me but not in a way that would actually cause me to consider walking out of a movie or discontinuing my viewing of a TV show, let alone one which I has previously enjoyed immensely. Well, congratulations D&D, you've managed to not only turn my stomach, but to actually offend me, which is difficult to do.Even the Sansa rape scene, which caused a lot of controversy, was something I didn't care for but could get over. My biggest gripe with it was that her decision to go to Winterfell and throw herself at the mercy of the people who cruelly murdered her mother and brother was quite obviously idiotic. She would never have done that. No one would. They used an extreme implausibility to create a situation where she would experience more torment. Still, I could live with it.For those who haven't seen this episode, spoiler alert here, but if you're prone to sensitivity you might rather read it here than watch it depicted on screen. This episode features a sweet young girl burned alive by her father. We listen to her writhe in agony begging for him to help her while he stands there doing nothing. He does it for personal ambition and aggrandizement, out of pure narcissism. I actually struggle to think of anything worse a human being could do. This is pushing *very* far into the extreme of immorality - this fiction is stranger than reality.Stannis Boratheon was a morally ambiguous, complex and interesting character before this episode. Now, he's simply a monster, one of several characters you just want to die and nothing more. It's poor writing, and it's done in service of pure shock value. It isn't even in the book. They just made it up as a way to top their previous excesses. Who knows what awaits in season 6. For those who are saying his choice is ""logical,"" I would say that since the character has existed in a gray area up to this point, either choice would have technically been ""logical."" The trouble is the very dilemma was concocted by the writers. Whether or not his choice was logical, this entire element did not have to be present in the story. Just like Ramsey raping Sansa was ""logical"" for the character (it was), but the situation only existed because the writers concocted. Both were done for cheap shock value, to generate banter and controversy. This one has gone to far, for me at least.As to the rest of the episode, some of it was good. I had walked out after the child being burned alive but my wife told me to watch the last part with Dany in the arena. It was a good. Not good enough to redeem the atrocity that was this episode."
183," Tasteless, illogical, needlessly brutal
",1,False,"What happened? until this season everything was going quite well, some great episodes, enjoyed watching... now? disaster, which clearly thinking person would find any logic in the current development of events? did the crew change completely? is it done by some dilettantes with the culture and aesthetics of a brainwashed and brain-damaged hog? what happened j.r.r. martin? you put so much effort and use your fantasy to create an extremely complex and interesting story only to give up on it for the ""show""? just some of the hideosities: 1. an obviously totally ""unwatched"" WAR CAMP starts burning from all sides(this is all done by 20 people) 2. a ""king"" or ""commander"" which expects to be respected after burning his daughter, 3. john snow promised a land to farm for the wildlings, but hey! winter is coming! 4. doran martel sending a teenager into the council 5.a man choosing a minor in a brothel for what purpose? i missed to get the message...everyone is reckless even without this 6.a fighter taking 3 minutes to shove his blade 3 inches into the throat of mormont 7.there are hundrets of the sons of the harpy , but no one throws a spear at daenerys, they seem to be struck by her... beauty? intellect?, 8,9 and 10 (a huge one) A SMILING DRAGON, THAT MAKES EVERYONE'S DAY!none of these parodies happen in the books, but i guess it's much easier to be stupid and tasteless, i just don't understand why(and where) is j.r.r. martin sleeping!"
184," Great episode, but untraditional to the series
",10,True,"Now, for starters, this was a very good episode, excellent in fact. Just before the fourth season, the actors and the director gave us an indication how season four was going to be less focused on the ninth episode alone and that the season was going to have large plot movement all the way throughout the season. While i did not feel this was true in season four, this represents season five 100%. As normal, the acting and the drama in this episode is holding up to the series standards, even more so! In the previous seasons i have been, what can i say... Not as excited for the 10th episode, reason being the 9th installment. This season it is not the case at all. Having left Kings Landing untouched, i cannot wait for the 10th episode.All in all, great acting from everyone involved, and it succeeds to keep us very much interested after the excitement of ""Hardhome"".""Dance of Dragons"" is not only one of the greatest episodes so far, but it left the audience very much exited for the 10th episode. Which IF there is something GOT have been lacking is exactly that."
185," Dancing with shock, tears and awe
",9,True,"Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.""The Dance of Dragons"" may not quite be on the same level as Season 5's magnum opus ""Hardhome"", also one of the best 'Game of Thrones' episodes overall. That is a very tall order, because that episode was so special and actually saw even those who found the previous Season 5 episodes slow going (personally feel that although not on the same level as the previous four seasons, and a flawed one, that all Season 5's episodes ranged from good to outstanding, not a popular opinion probably) impressed. Although the polarisation of the fan reaction is understandable, count me in as somebody who loved ""The Dance of Dragons"" overall. Not without faults, no didn't think it was a perfect or 10/10 episode. The special effects have been much more polished before and the Dorne storyline (a consistent criticism of Season 5 among critics and fans) is not as interesting or as involving as the rest of the episode, also a bit silly.However, ""The Dance of Dragons"" is notable especially for two scenes. One is the whole climax in Meereen, especially in Daznak's Pit, which was spectacular, exciting and thrillingly intense with Daenerys' role being iconic for her and of the show visually and dramatically. The other is the episode's most controversial scene with Stannis and Shireen, one of the most tragic and disturbing of the whole of 'Game of Thrones' and the most hard-hitting the show has been since the Red Wedding. It shocked me and it brought me to tears.Am going to defend this scene now considering how much it's been criticised and talked about. Can understand the problems others had with this scene, with them showing dislike for Stannis turning from morally complex to a monster by one act which has been described as out of character and a character distortion. For me, that is true for book Stannis but not show Stannis, remember this is a character who would stop at nothing to get what he wants and he had shown numerous murderous traits actually since Season 2 and for trivial reasons, also he was much less wilful initially here than he was with those showing some moral complexity still. Getting back on track, once again cannot fault the acting, with strong performances from Emilia Clarke, Kit Harington, Carice Van Houten and particularly Stephen Dillane in some of his best acting as Stannis to date.Plot lines and character development continue to advance, there is a perfect balance of intricate character moments and drama and there is a powerful mix of heart-wrenching poignancy, nail-biting intensity and shocking revelations.Visually, ""The Dance of Dragons"" looks amazing (apart from the effects), as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about ""The Dance of Dragons"" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.Writing continues to be layered and thoughtful and the storytelling riveting.In conclusion, excellent if divisive episode. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
186," Daznak's Pit
",10,True,"The Dance of Dragons is the best episode from Season 5. And the last scene of the episode, at Daznak's Pit, was one of the most enjoyable in the series so far. Per Game of Thrones tradition, episode 9 is reserved for the most significant events for that season. And this one certainly lived up to it, never failing to excite all the way to the thrilling climax. The story follows the main protagonists Daenerys, Tyrion, Stannis, Jorah, and Daario as they attempt to outwit and outmaneuver their enemies. Who will survive and who will die? Those are the questions most often asked when watching the crowning episode of the every season. Some of the story lines will make you cry while some will have you jumping for joy."
187," Greek tragedy meets medieval fantasy
",10,True,"Watching this episode reminded me of a certain story in Greek mythology I read as a kid. It is a prelude to the Trojan War, where King Agamemnon and the Achaean army are stuck in the port town Aulida due to the windless weather. Then the seer Calchas suggest to Agamemnon that his daughter must be sacrificed to win the favor of the gods and for the wind to blow again. Agamemnon sorrowfully agrees, and his daughter Iphigeneia is put on an altar to be slaughtered when goddess Artemis intervenes and switches her with a deer. The gods are satisfied though, and the army sails on Troy to begin the siege. This is a tragedy written by Euripides named ""Iphigeneia in Aulida"" with which I observe several similarities with the Stannis/Shireen situation, though I doubt R'hllor is as merciful as Artemis. I admit I was appalled by Stanis' decision to sacrifice his daughter, a character build to attract great sympathy. But in the end anyone can appreciate some tragedy, especially when it helps build up the enjoyment of what is to follow, a low point before a great climax.So Shireen is sacrificed some time after she recites to her father the epic story named the Dance of Dragons, a foreshadowing for Drogon's boogie time. In Meereen spirits are high for the spectacle to follow, ""circenses"" for the people to enjoy. Danny is still adamant about people dying for no reason lest the enjoyment of others, but she claps the start of the fights. To be honest I was almost certain that Ser Jorah was to die in this episode, slowly being petrified and at an emotional nadir, but he survives this fight and atones himself in the eyes of Daenerys killing her would-be assailant. What follows is a massive slaughter leading to a desperate situation for two of the three major plot characters in the series. But, uncharacteristically for this series, the underdogs survive due to the coming of the prodigal son, who wreaks havoc and mayhem on the pit, protecting his mother and burning and biting everyone threatening her. The climax intensifies when Danny rides on the small Black Dread, whispering a new (to the audience) Valyrian command and the two take off to places unknown, leaving everyone stupefied.This episodes epitomes what I like in Game of Thrones. Human tragedy and gritty action with some fantasy overlay. This is an excellent, satisfying episode, picking the pace of the last one (quality wise) and leaving us hyped and excited about the next week finale.10/10"
188," Most underrated episode of got!
",10,True,"Well, this episode is in my opinion among the best ones, and absolutely the second best season ending (winds of winter is probably extremely hard, if not impossible to top)that we have had! This episode is very intense all the way through, and is extremely underrated! I see a lot of bad reviews for this episode and i cant seem to understand what the problem with this episode is! Its very intense, very entertaining, and has a insane ending, Which made it very hard to wait just three days (i got finished with got three days before season 6)!"
189," Your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth
",10,True,"""Okay first of all I just want to say that I absolutely love(d) Game of Thrones, but I will not watch Game of Thrones ever again after this episode.""Talk about a juxtaposition.If you're prepared to never watch a show again which you supposedly loved after watching this season's finale then you were never truly a fan to begin with.Game of Thrones, since the very beginning, has killed off main characters without second thought: Ned, Catelyn, Robb and Talisa (and their unborn child), Joffrey, Oberyn, Ygritte, Tywin - you get the picture. People die in Game of Thrones. Nobody is safe. I get it, it's upsetting seeing the characters you care about butchered on screen - the Red Wedding had me in ruins - but come on, you should never expect any characters to be safe on this show! Surely everyone knows that by now?I will admit that I personally felt totally shocked by the episode. And I was entirely confused: killing Jon Snow? What? But we just built up his character for ages and he just barely survived at Hardhome so why kill him off now?And then I thought about it, read some reviews and theories, and calmed down again.Believe it or not, D&D (the dudes in charge) do actually know what they're doing. They set the scene up at Castle Black very particularly: Melisandre arrives looking sullen and in need of enlightenment, clearly prepared to grasp at anything, and then Jon dies. It's no coincidence - as some have already pointed out - that the two characters happen to be in the same place at the same time. Melisandre no longer has Stannis to channel the Lord of Light through, so I am confident she will seize this opportunity to reanimate Jon Snow.All in all, though, this season is - in my opinion - the weakest of the five so far. Season four was absolutely stellar, so season five naturally had quite a lot to live up to, and therefore unfortunately I don't believe it matched the quality of the preceding season. I feel that they tried to fit too much into too few episodes - we never saw anymore of Margaery or Loras, the Dorne storyline was dragged out, and the battle at Winterfell was skipped entirely. However, this season was by no means a poor season, just a season with a rougher start than the others, and perhaps too many story lines to juggle at once.Whether you loved this episode or hated it, loved this season or hated it, you have to admit that there is a lot to look forward to next season: Tyrion and Varys ruling Meereen (temporarily); Daenerys and the Dothraki; Cersei, Loras and Margaery's trials; Littlefinger's plans now that Stannis' army is gone; Brienne's plans; Sansa's fate; Arya's future serving the Many-Faced-God; the White Walkers army; the Wildlings and the Night's Watch; and Melisandre's future in relation to Jon Snow.Unfortunately, though, we have to wait quite some time before we can see where these story lines end up. And likely by the time April 2016 comes around, those who are frustrated and devastated just now will have forgotten their pain and be lured back into Westeros once again. Until then, Valar Morghulis."
190," Great Season 5 Finale
",10,True,"I have read many comments about GAME OF THRONES season 5 finale: from excellent to outstanding to downright predictable and boring. I tend to stick with the first. I, like many other viewers of this show, have become addicted to the story in the seven kingdoms. There's some serious advancement in the multiple storyline: Jon Snow dies stabbed to death by his own Night's Watch brothers, Arya becomes a pupil of the Many Faced God only to be left apparently blind, Stannis Baratheon finally realizes that all those prophecies Melisandre raved about are untrue and that his daughter's sacrifice turned out to be the finest example in futility. Tyrion Lannister forges an alliance with Daenerys Targaryen, who is left by her dragon in the middle of nowhere while escaping a coup in the city of Meereen. We see Daenrys being surrounded by hordes of Dothraki riders with the intention of kidnapping her. Meanwhile in Winterfell, Theon ""Reek"" Greyjoy and Sansa Stark make a desperate escape from Ramsay Bolton as he arrives from his winning battle with Stannis. Last but not least, we have Cersei Lannister's walk of ""atonement"", where the regent Queen mother of King's Landing is force to purge her sins in front of the city's population, naked and escorted by the brutal Septa Unella who whips a bell as she chants, ""shame"".It's the only scene I've heard friends say, ""poor Cersei"", or ""this is too much for her"". Apparently these friends have forgotten that it was Cersei who started all this mess by ordering her lover/brother Jamie Lannister to push young Brandon Stark off the window of a high tower. Until the army of the dead make it south of the wall, Cersei remains the main antagonist in the story, the main ""bad guy"" in GAME OF THRONES, even more so than the Boltons, or the treacherous Night's Watch brothers, or the fanatical Sons of the Harpy.I do feel however that some loose ends have to start veering in a more concrete way to their conclusions. 1. Sansa Stark - So far she's played the ""damsel in distress"" prototype. Season 6 has to make her transition into a tough as nails bitch. After the killing of almost her entire family, she needs to take the reigns and start plotting revenge on those who've wronged her family.2. Daenerys Targaryen - I understand that she needs to get to King's Landing in order to regain what' ""rightfully hers"" yet (as of episode 9, Season 5) she seems to be pretty comfortable in Meereen. What is she waiting for?3. Jon Snow - He is obviously NOT dead. You can't have so much build up on one character only to kill him off just like that. Why did Ned Stark never told him who his mother was? Why did the White Walker stared at him in the battle of Hardhome? Why did Melisandre tried to seduced him? Why did Maester Aemon told him to ""Kill the boy""? Jon Snow's storyline will continue for sure!4. Cersei Lannister - She's defied almost everyone in her path, friend and foe alike, and it's been established that's she's been a raging bitch since she was a little girl (as seen on the first episode of season 5). It's a wonder no one has tried to poison her or kill her, yet her walk of atonement in season's 5 finale has been her embrace with pure, unadulterated humiliation. She will eventually slay those involved in her most disgraceful hour before someone finally slays her.5. Tyrion Lannister - My favorite character, will have to prove that his alliance with Daenerys must pay off with peace for the Seven Kingdoms, as Lord Varys has expressed.Forget the naysayers: ""Mother's Mercy"" was a great finale for season 5. I hope season 6 is even more exciting!"
191," The North Remembers
",9,True,"Well I think Game of Thrones can now be considered the most miserable show I have ever seen. Yes, I love this show. It's incredibly well-written and is consistently the most shocking series every year, but I feel like the show doesn't have to be this much of a bummer every week. But I guess I asked for it. Because last week was a bit of a letdown in terms of the amount of surprising things that happened, this week picked up for it.We began in the North where Stannis and his men are losing people by the second but they decide to march on anyway. Even after Melisandre surprising leaves, Stannis gave Winterfell one last shot. For all he has done in this show good or bad, I think he was just a man trying to fulfill his destiny. For awhile I thought he was the most fit for the throne, and even to an extent up until his death. But seeing Brienne finally get her revenge for Remly was good enough. Now that Stannis is dead, and his wife killed herself, are there any Baratheon's left? Especially considering Tommen is really a Lannister. No matter, I was somewhat disappointed that they didn't actually show Stannis' death and cut away to Ramsay killing more people. Moving onto Winterfell, we finally saw Theon AKA Reek redeem himself and save Sansa. By the way, how can they possibly survive that fall? Onto another Stark, Arya had quite the night. Her bada** turn felt a little too quick but was nonetheless exciting to finally see her get revenge on somebody from her list, much different than letting the Hound die for himself last year.But as you may have predicted, Jaqen H'ghar knew what Arya was up to and seemingly made her pay for her failures. This was yet another incredible scene and one that didn't have too much closure. I don't think she's dead but the Arya we know and love is sure to have changed forever. We then got a brief scene with Jaime leaving Dorne. His moment with Myrcella was very sweet as he finally embraced who he actually is to his own daughter. That is until the poison from Ellaria Sand kicked in and killed her. I expect to see an all out war next season between the two families (once again, nothing's ever happy for people in this show). Back in Meereen, we had perhaps the only pleasant scene all night as Tyrion and the gang decide what to do without their queen. I quite enjoyed the scene and really like where it's heading. Especially now knowing Varys is back in the equation. Dany on the other-hand looks to be heading down a similar path as season 1 as she was presumably captured by the Dothraki. But I think she is much better prepared than she was all those years back. All this to digest and the two biggest scenes I haven't even talked about yet.Back in King's Landing, it was time for Cersei Lannister to pay due for her crimes, but did any of us expect this much embarrassment? Her atonement included being stripped of everything she has protected for years. She quite literally bared everything that Cersei stood for. I wonder if this will be similar to when Jaime lost the hate back a few seasons and we start to root for the character? No matter, I know one thing, it was darn impossible not to feel for her while she walked blocks nude and endured as much physical pain as mental pain. As we had back to the Wall, Jon Snow has already said goodbye to Sam as he heads for the Citadel, and now he finds out that Stannis has died and Melisandre has returned to presumably re-up her mission with Snow, another royal blood. Little did I know that the Olly kid would betray and turn him over to the rest of the watch to murder him. By far the most heartbreaking death I have watched on this show. Jon Snow is one of the only genuinely good guys in the show. It seemed like there was insane amount of potential with his character (considering the R+L=J theory). But as Game of Thrones too often does, his death came far too soon. It's by far the biggest Game of Thrones episode to date. So much happened and so much was set up. In many ways, this was the episode that last week could have been. I just hope that one day this show lets the good guys win. Most deaths make sense, I'm just not seeing the point of Snow's death. The North Remembers.+Wrapped a ton of stories up +Non-stop paced +Revenge & redemption for some +Funny and pleasant Meereen scene +Fitting end to an otherwise down year+Cersei pays +Sweet Jaime scene...-...Only to end miserably -Can the good guys ever win? We will miss you Snow 9.5/10"
192," Elation to Despair in one episode - thats Game of thrones
",10,True,"If Elation was the word for Episode 9, its despair the word for Episode 10. Having already read the books prior, I was ready for what was to come. In spite of that, this episode was like a punch in my stomach. While many will talk about what happened at wall, I would look at the events at Dorne & Kings Landing. For the first time in 5 seasons, we had a episode that emotionally affected the Lannisters. They have been the hated characters of Game of Thrones - but am sure Episode 10 gave a different perspective to their characters. Lannisters - always pays their debt & the 2 events at Dorne & Kings Landing could have huge repercussions in next coming season.At the wall...its anyone's guess. Problem with guess work is it doesn't always work in Game of Thrones. All in all, a gripping season finale. Shame we have to wait for another 10 months to start all over..."
193," It had to happen
",9,True,What people don't realize is there was no other way Jon Snow was going to leave the nightswatch.He is way too stubborn and honourable to break his vows.Just like his father.Therefore he had to die.And must come back.
194," Way too fast paced.
",6,False,"(No book spoilers, but heavy episode spoilers)Before you down vote this because you think it's a ""the book is not like the show"" complaint just know this : I don't mind the show diverging from the books, in fact I'm happy about it. Book 4 and 5 aren't really fit for television and I don't want the show to spoil book 6 and 7.My problem isn't with the changes, but in how they were executed. This episode went so fast it's almost as if Sonic the Hedgehog had written it. Stannis' storyline that has been built up during 4 seasons is brought to an end in about 7 minutes with hasty writing and skipped scenes. Making one of the most interesting character feel like a second thought is bad pacing. Like ""look I know he loses and all but we've got to put 200 pages in the rest of the show so let's get it over with"". If you ran out of time then just postpone the battle of Winterfell until the next season, like GRRM did.Daenerys' storyline gets more time than Stannis even though that one could've been shortened, we get it, her dragon is injured and wants to sleep around like a tired cat. No need to rub it in. Same for her council back in Meereen. And yeah, she finds a Dothraki tribe again, but did we really need to see them circling around her for 3 more minutes ? Wasn't this episode full enough as it is ?Cersei's storyline was really well done and is the saving grace of this episode. It's that kind of writing that should have prevailed.Arya's part was also pretty good.But the worst of all... Jon Snow. My god, when I saw his scene and realized there were only 5 minutes left, I really thought there was no way they were going to put his death in. But they did. Just look at when main characters died in other episodes, look at the crescendo of Ned Stark's death, or how incredible the Red Wedding was. Then why, oh why, did one of the most beloved character in the show only get 4 minutes of screen time for his death ? Hardhome is an example of how changes from the books to the show can be good, that scene lasted 25 minutes, giving plenty of time to build tension, it's good writing. It felt satisfying and realistic, butchering a character in 2 minutes for the sake of it is not.I just can't like this episode, they should have delayed some events to the next season or made 2 episodes, but they wanted to fit everything in only one and as a result, it felt rushed and poorly done.So I give this episode a 6/10, and I'd give it a way lower score if it wasn't part of a show I liked so much and the Cersei part."
195," Neglecting good story telling in lieu of shocking audiences.
",4,False,"This episode, ending a season full of disappointment and poor characterization, was the final nail in a coffin for me. Inside of that coffin lay some of the greatest books ever written, some of the greatest characters I've ever been introduced to, and any hopes that the remaining seasons of this show will be worth watching. David Benioff and D.B. Weiss have proved, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that they are not interested in telling the story of the ASoIaF books the way they were meant to be told, but are instead interested in creating a story that shocks and saddens audiences, while continuing to prove, time and time again, the the good guys will never win, nor is there even any hope that they will.This episode left viewers with multiple cliffhangers and almost no stories resolved, or even in a position to be resolved. Mother's Mercy was the last chance for season 5 to actually tell a coherent story, and I think it failed miserably. The season finale rendered so many plot lines in the story completely irrelevant. Sansa, Stannis, Dorne as a whole, Littlefinger. All of these story lines saw no real resolution. Only shocks, twists, and untimely deaths.Sansa was basically ditched in Winterfell, and all season, viewers were left wondering how she would prevail, and grow stronger as a character. Instead, all we saw was Sansa in the same position she has been in since season 1, playing the role of the victim, scared and alone in a place where she has no friends. Oh, and don't forget the scene where her virginity is taken from her in a completely unnecessary rape scene whose only purpose was to shock and anger audiences.Stannis, one of, if not the greatest tactician and military commander in the Game of Thrones world, was defeated and presumably killed in the most unspectacular fashion imaginable, by a lone soldier that vowed multiple times in the series to kill him. How convenient and disappointing. Brienne, after gazing longingly at Winterfell for 8 episodes, finally just happens to run into the one person in the entire world that she wants to kill to avenge her old love. I thought maybe, just maybe, there would be a perfect scene in which Brienne finally fulfills the oath she swore to Catelyn Stark. She would rescue Sansa, and even Theon, face off against Roose or Ramsay Bolton, destroy them and their plot armor that has let them become seemingly unkillable villains, and we would finally see one story line resolve itself happily.I can say almost certainly that I will not be huddled around my television when season 6 premieres, and I suspect many others feel the same as I do. D&D should be ashamed of the travesty that they've created and allowed to be aired on television."
196," Soooo underrated
",10,True,This was too good. Really unerrated episode. I'll give it 10 out of 10
197," Anticlimactic, and a truly broken adaptation,
",6,False,"Definitively, the worst season finale of the show to date. every single scene fell out of place barring the last, with the climactic battle of winterfell happening early on, followed predominantly by long winded discussions and shock value bullshit that completely contradicts the books, that unless I'm very much mistaken, the series is supposed to at least partially adhere to... more pointless deaths that don't happen in the books, more plot derailment, and a completely botched final scene, that- in the books was a far more subtle, vague and chilling chapter the changes made are nonsensical and moronic in terms of writing (in the books, Jon Snow's fate came at the hand of a few lower down the chain, not his effective replacement) and Myrcella's death is a bundle of utter pointlessness that just rendered an already middling plot line to be near enough POINTLESS. After four sterling seasons, it appears the show has completely lost its wits. the number of things left totally up in the air, such as the fates of Stannis and Sansa are extremely cheap cliffhangers, and leave the episode feeling more like one that should have been at the middle of the season.The worst season of game of thrones to date, signs out with its absolute worst episode."
198," Death and Despair
",9,True,As season five of Game of Thrones comes to an end we visit most of the major character and see what is happening to them in most cases it is not something good. In Braavos Arya manages to kill Meryn Trant but her satisfaction is short lived; his death was not sanctioned by the Many-faced God so there will be a heavy price to pay. In Meereen Jorah Mormont and Daario Naharis leave to search for Daenerys leaving Tyrion to run the city. Meanwhile Daenerys is far to the north with her sick dragon; here she finds herself surrounded by a Dothraki hoard.Back in Westeros Jaime and Bronn sail from Dorne but relief soon turns to despair for Jaime when his daughter collapses; poisoned by Ellaria Sand. North of Winterfell Stannis learns that half his army have departed and his wife has hanged herself; then Melisandre abandons him leaving him to face the Bolton's army with just a small number of foot soldiers. In Winterfell Sansa and Theon take drastic measures to get away from Ramsey. Further south in King's Landing Cersei confesses to one of the crimes she has confessed to and is forced to undergo a humiliating penance. At Castle Black Sam departs with Gilly before Alliser Thorne confronts Jon Snow in one of the series' most shocking moments to date.This was certainly one of the most downbeat series finale's to date; indeed it looks as though many major characters have died although the fact that we didn't always see the moment of death leaves open the possibility that some will survive. It will be a long wait to find out! Thankfully it wasn't all depressing; it was good to see Sam and Gilly leave Castle Black and the reunion of Tyrion and Varys was equally pleasing. The fact that the story visited each of the protagonists did mean we didn't get to stay with any of them long which was a pity but something that couldn't really be helped as none of the sections seemed superfluous. The cast did a fine job; particular mention much go to Lena Headey; her performance was brilliant and brave as Cersei is humiliated and forced to walk naked through the streets of King's Landing; there was nothing erotic about her nudity and for once it was hard not to feel sympathy for Cersei. Overall I'd say this was a cracking conclusion to a fairly solid season; I look forward to Season Six.
199," All good things must come to an end
",6,False,"Where do one start. Game of thrones has provided us with 4 great seasons of adaptations of the books. However, all good things must come to an end. The show writers have clearly showed their incompetence now. I think it's safe to say, that all the book readers and non-book readers agree that some changes are needed, to make a series of the books. However, as Benioff and Weiss has showed us, you can't do too many changes. And that's exactly what they did with season 5. Yes, the show is now ahead of the books in some story lines, but no, that's not an excuse.Benioff and Weiss have decided that shock value (although few of the events were even shocking) is more important than good writing. So lets start with Jon Snow being stabbed. In the breakdown of the episode they talk about how they didn't want a ''bad guy'' like Alliser Thorne to kill Jon. So they decide that Ollie should ''surprise'' us all and stab him. Although it has been clear for almost the entire season, that Ollie would do something stupid when Jon returned with the Free Folk. It was simply predictable and boring.The battle for Winterfell was almost a major disappointment. I don't mind that Stannis lost the battle. We still don't know the results in the books, but I assume he loses in the books as well, or this would have been an EXTREMELY stupid way to go for the show. However. Stannis is supposed to significantly outnumber the Bolton force, and he's perhaps the greatest general in Westeros. Take that, and combine it with the build up they've done for the entire season, and you'll get one hell of an ending to the season. Or not. Because what the f*ck, happened? In the show half of the army desert before the battle. OK, but that if he had such a large force to begin with, he shouldn't have been so outnumbered as he was. Not to mention how he just walked into a trap, and then not even preparing a strategy. They didn't even show the battle. So what was the point of the build up then? And then, at the end you have Brienne killing Stannis, with some stupid logic. I mean, you butchered the character of Brienne and Stannis in one episode. Do you really mean that Brienne was THAT stupid? ''Rightful king''. What!? Everyone. And I mean EVERYONE in Westeros knew Stannis was the rightful king by law. It doesn't mean they supported him, but they weren't stupid. Brienne obviously was.The Sand Snakes continue to be awkward and bad. ''You want a good girl but need a bad pussy''. Are you shooting a porn? Like seriously, WHAT THE F*CK!? How did anyone come up with lines like those? And yet again, you kill off a character who haven't died in the books (and probably won't do anytime soon either).Theon rescuing Sansa from Miranda, only to jump of the wall in what seems like a suicide. What a surprise! Now we're left with a useless cliffhanger.These are just some of the things I've found bad with the episode, I could have gone on for much more, but that wouldn't leave place for why I didn't rate the episode 1 star. For even though the episode were at times incredibly stupid, some parts were brilliant. Cerseis walk of shame, and the incident with Arya was both well done storyline-wise, and actually done in the show. Making an otherwise stupid episode at least watchable, and also earning it 6 stars fr"
200," More than a bloodbath, more like blood-lake!
",10,True,"This series has always been known to dish out profoundly gut-wrenching scenes, and this finale was just another example. If Season 5 hasn't been a bloodbath for you yet, there's more blood spillt in this episode than probably in the last nine combined. Jam-packed full of story lines, this is one the fans will never forget - for many reasons.Starting from the beginning, this looked to be an epic tale through death and destruction. The Baratheon line is quickly being eradicated with the death of Shireen last week, and now both her parents. Selyse' suicide comes as slightly a surprise, but we could not blame her for that remorse she showed after witnessing the burning of her daughter. Of King Stannis though, his death is unclear as of yet. Brienne, unfortunately missed Sansa's sign at the window, but it seems in the end, got her revenge for the one King she could be loyal to, Renly Baratheon.The only slight criticism I have for the finale is the rushed feeling of Stannis's death and Sansa' escape, which is no denying exciting for both Sansa and Theon. Myranda was the next to die as she took a tumble from the battlements. It's just a shame it wasn't Ramsey. Otherwise, this cliffhanger (literally) seems quite adequate, but will be agonising for those of us begging for Season 6. In Braavos, we got mixed emotions. Firstly, we got to see Arya in full ""badass"" mode, turning Meryn Trant into a sniveling boy, before killing him permanently. But, we knew Arya's success must come at a price and she is forcefully blinded by Jaqen H'ghar in the midst of his trickery as a Faceless Man. Funny that she lost her sight, and the first weakness that she went for of Ser Meryn was his eyes.Dorne went from diplomatic calm-ville to a surprising twist, which was all orchestrated by the deceptive Ellaria Sand. Owing to her failure earlier on in the season, she played the long game and allowed Myrcella to die in the end, just like many of the Dornish people with some exotic poison no doubt. Heaven knows, I thought the scene between Jaime and his daughter was quite beautiful until all hell broke loose. But that's Game of Thrones for you.Talk about filling the time, we also had Tyrion, Daario and Jorah discussing what to do next following Daenerys' flight. I think it's a great decision to leave Tyrion in charge of Meereen and I'm intrigued to see how he does it. Equally, Daenerys' cliffhanger was tantalising as she's regrettably reunited with the khalasar under a new Khal. I wonder if they recognise her as the late Drogo's wife?The best performance of the night, and probably the best scene of the episode was Cersei's atonement. Despite having a body double for the long shots, Lena Headey's performance is utterly stupendous as the walk of shame came about. Some might point out the unnecessary length of the scene, but I believe it showed the true nature of Cersei's character - one who has sinned pretty much all her life and now she is reduced to tears. There's no doubt she's want revenge, but for a few moments, the viewers won't be able to help feeling sorry for that torture. Also, Gregor Clegane has had a transformation at last, thanks to the ever loyal Qyburn.Finally, we come to the Wall as developments happen in quick succession and mutiny unfolds. Sam decides to go to Oldtown with Gilly and the baby, a storyline that we will probably be following closely in Season 6 and Davos heard the terrible news from Stannis' field. But most significant of all, and probably something that will be discussed and scrutinised for the next ten months, was Jon's saddening death as his Night's Watchmen stab him to his death, not to mention Olly's betrayal. His only hope now is a miracle (which may not be surprising in GoT), but until an alternative appears, we can be sure that he's well and truly dead.An episode that leaves a desolation in its wake, not to mention many teary eyes from the viewers as we say goodbye to a number of characters in one go. Those who are obsessed with the show will probably have no hope of surviving the gap between finale and premiere of the next season, but we'll certainly try. Following a stunning performance, that left me speechless for a while, I can honestly I'm very satisfied with how the season came about. Congratulations to D&D for their adaption - it's a winner!9.6/10"
201," Easily the Weakest Finale to any GOT Season
",7,False,"While it maintains a good quality in many areas game of thrones excels at (dialogue, artistic direction, etc) in most other areas the episode falls flat in relation to the previous episodes. Some of the major character deaths are done poorly and purely for shock value and some of the content is just blatantly annoying.Everybody knows what Game of Thrones does the best so I'll move quickly onto my major criticisms of this episode.1. Most of the deaths were done just for the sake of death. Although Theon and Sansa's suicide was touching in itself it was utterly pointless due to Brienne not 'seeing' the candle - much like something out a soap opera. This would've been much better if she saw the candle and had to make a decision between killing Stannis and saving Sansa, which moves onto the next criticisms.2. When Brienne killed Stannis her motivation, although clear, wasn't very strong at all. Her devotion to Renly was without sufficient explanation in the first place but the fact she believes he is the rightful ruler by blood only serves to make her seem stupid and ignorant.3. The logistics behind the Bolton garrison at Winterfell is ridiculous. It had already been stated that Stannis's army massively outnumbered the Boltons and even with ≈50% reduction from desertion Stannis' army size and performance in relation to the Bolton's seemed lacklustre and the Sudden appearance of the cavalry was ridiculous - it would have taken a much longer time to get the cavalry out of the walls so unless GRRM has given the Boltons the power to teleport it is quite ridiculous. The whole battle seem was disappointing, possibly due to time constraints (as the episode was full of content.)4. Stupid writing from D&D resurfaces as they make Meryn Trant, who was not only a murderer and a pedophile (which was already pretty over-the-top), he's now also a child beater! The only way they could have exaggerated this more was if they made him grow red horns as he was beating the children. However - I must say that the rest of the scene and the content involving Arya was much more interesting than previously.5. The sand snake dialogue - ""You want a good girl but you need the bad pussy."" Do I really need to explain my dissatisfaction at this?Overall, although this made for a disappointing finale when compared to the rest of the finales it was still the second best episode in the Season, behind 'Hardhome,' and despite its flaws it's still good TV. Hopefully the decrease in overall season quality does not continue."
202," Build up to no battle screwed over again
",5,False,"one of the things that used to bug the hell out of me in the early G.O.T seasons was the budgetary requirement that battles couldn't really be shown . so we had all the talking, preparing, build up and then ...aftermath .Tyrion wakes up after very conveniently getting knocked out .Robb lets his wolves loose on the lanister army then... no battle .We get the same thing now for an entire season All stannis has been doing is talking ,preparing ,plotting and planning to take winter fell from the boltons and it leads to a build up to sweet bugger all. A bitter disappointment ,I thought they had the budget to match their imagination these days but no ,still pulling the same old ""walking dead"" style tricks."
203," Mercy is not for everyone, humility is.
",10,True,"This is not a good episode for royalties, almost everyone holding seat of power have terrible fate waiting for them. As expected repercussions of burning his child, Stannis finds himself with less aid than he had. In a rather anticlimactic fashion, he is steamrolled by the Boltons. This is as one sided as they come, Stannis' survival is highly questionable and if he does miraculously escape culling, his case for the throne is practically over.Arya has her wish granted, mostly by her own hand. She seems to channel assassin from Kill Bill and eventually crosses one name off her list. All with a hefty price though. Maisie Williams takes the character to unknown territory, she always has knack for deceptively malicious intent, but claiming her own kill will change the character, for better or worse.The other princesses are also lost. Her sister Sansa finds herself in troublesome situation and also serendipitously a help in unexpected form. After seasons of abuse, Theon finally has his moment of salvation. The two take the leap of faith together, and this is the most hope given for young ladies in the episode.On Jaime's side, he eventually obtains a bit of solace with her daughter. He does not have much spotlight this season, his time is spent mostly on brooding and bantering. It's a breath of fresh air when he's embraced by his flesh and blood. This lasts three seconds as this princess doesn't even make it to the wedding. Poison of the viper runs deep in the family.The aftermath of arena skirmish unites eclectic party in Meereen. This is the epitome of fantasy group with warriors and strategists assembled. Daenerys has gathered colorful subordinates as Tyrion takes on the duty of taming another wild city which seems to have given him some sense of purpose. However, Daenerys herself is in foreign territory, although a lot of strangers clamoring around her is not particularly new for her.The episode, and season, ends with tragic public prosecution of Cersei and Jon Snow. Cersei takes a literal walk of shame as she is humbled in public. It's admittedly hard to witness as her rigid defense is gradually crumbling, but this might just fuel more hatred for next season. Meanwhile, Jon Snow is unfortunately as cold as his name implies.This season has been nice in all the darkest ways. See you next time."
204," Mother's Mercy? More like Major Disappointment.
",1,False,"*I have not read the books* *Game of Thrones was one of my favorite TV-series*Season 5 of Game of Thrones has felt off canon the whole season, and it's no wonder as that is what it is by fact. The epicness Martin built the former 4 seasons - and which was delivered - has now ended after the TV series took its own train to wreck. Especially in the finale. The brutal awe we loved has turned into overused clichés and drama writing which is now aimed for a totally new audience, the audience who loves the TV and the cinema we GoT fans hated in the first place. The slowly built awesomeness has now turned into a spoon-feeding massacre which you see a mile away, the easiest way is now chosen every single time. Characters are killed without any reason story-wise. The personalities we saw the last 4 seasons have been changed, they have been turned into completely different people, not in the name of character development or new ideas, not for their own benefit, but solely in the name of the TV-series and its progression. Everything is done in the name of the pacing. This makes the whole season rushed, it rapes half the characters and makes the writing so predictable and lackcluster-ish that one can only wonder if the series changed from GoT to LotR, but no, this is worse. Game of Thrones has ended and D&D has started. Time to empty those hard drives and go buy the books. I will not watch season 6 and neither will any Game of Thrones fan who doesn't wish to hate the series."
205," This time it's just bull****
",3,False,"OK, we agree that we all love unexpected twist and turns, and the unpredictable shows are always the best.We loved so many surprises in this show and that's part of what made GoT so good.I haven't read the books, but I've heard they want to stray away from them to keep it more interesting. No argue there.But this time, what we see in this episode is a meaningless death (I'm not spoiling anything, of course you expect someone to die in the last episode of a season, don't you?).There is simply no real reason to do that, clearly this is not how the story is meant to go on, and it makes so much of what has already happened basically pointless. It washes away a lot of what we've seen, and I won't be surprised if more people will do what I will: give up the series and start reading the books.I don't know whose idea this was (Martin's or the producers'), but IMO it is purely a run for sensational, and an attempt to attract publicity through shock.I believe that this episode was a total failure."
206," Stop rating 1 all those who don't understand GOT
",10,True,"POSSIBLE SPOILERS FOR ALL READERS AHEAD !I read all the comments on this episode, and I won't repeat what others have said about how great this episode is. But I get really annoyed when I see people giving nasty reviews because they do not understand that there is a reason, and a purpose, behind every death that occurred in this series. And by the way, rest easy, Jon Snow is not ""dead"". But there is no greatness without suffering, no success without sacrifice, and no happiness without sadness. We all loved Game of Thrones because of its unpredictability, its plot twists, its lack of cheesy clichés. And this is what GOT delivered in all seasons. And some say Season 5 started out slowly. But so did the other seasons, and no one mentioned a thing. Or were you expecting the storm after Twin's death ? And I will stop here, because I know that there are people who say Lord of the Rings it's nonsense, so whatever, I'm not going to waste my time convincing people that don't want to understand the notion of ""greater goal""."
207," Season 5 A Choppy/Sloppy Mess
",1,False,"Unlike so many prone to sing praises of GOT this season, I completely disagree. Many times during this season I questioned why I was bothering to watch this show. My sense was that it was mainly because of it's better past and hoping for some return to former glory or some kind of redemption for sucking away so much of my time and energy. The writing this season many times left me feeling that the writers really didn't want to do the show anymore. Story lines grew weak and characters grew flat. There were a few places that it lived up to expectations based on past success but for the most part this season and most of all this finale were sub par. I have not read the books. And while I didn't care for some of the directions that story lines took, all of that could have been overcome by better writing. Granted based on past success there was a lot to live up to, but this season the writers did a very poor job. If I decide to watch next season at all, it will be after it is over so I don't waste time wondering what will happen. Based on this season it would be constant disappointment."
208," With its moments, but again naive and sloppy
",5,False,"I was so angry at the previous episode's butchering of the story that I watched this one heavily prejudiced. A fair I think conclusion is that this season finale had some great moments (unsurprisingly those that were closest to book canon) and some others that could, even within the context of the vastly ruined show story lines, work quite powerfully except for one little thing: when they are not adapting material, Benioff and Weiss are proving increasingly incapable of avoiding black holes in the plot that even a toddler could spot. Exhibit 1: Shireen's sacrifice has melted the snows, allowing Stannis' leftover army to reach Winterfell. A couple of hours later. On foot. If that isn't a ridiculous trade-off I don't know what is.Now, again, it's not that it's different than the book. It's that the book version makes sense. Why did Melisandre sacrifice Shireen and not someone else of royal blood (they're still there in the show)? Why didn't she do the same spell that got rid of Renly? In the book, well, she isn't there. That makes sense. How do you explain that everything she had so far done in the show had worked and now she failed so miserably? Why is Ramsay Snow treated like some sort of Marvel Supervillain? Most importantly, how were the Boltons preparing for a siege and yet apparently kept a laughably large army inside the keep? Which the often praised for military prowess in previous episodes Stannis knew nothing about? These aren't small details; for a show of this budget, fame, production, I'm not letting you get away with such a horrible mess of a plot. Especially not when you could have avoided everything by sticking to the book. This sloppiness ruins even the, I will begrudgingly admit, fine moments of the Winterfell sequence, like Selyse's suicide. Because for every good moment, you get a ""suddenly Sansa can pick a lock"" or a ""totally unjustified by the script conversion of Reek"".But there was more than the Winterfell battle, thankfully. The Dorne story sees another divergence (though it was already so different it doesn't count much). At least this time the Dorne scenes advanced the plot a bit. But something needs to be done about the Sand Snakes. They cast a few beautiful and likely talented actresses and they are feeding them the most ridiculous lines - there was only one in this episode and I was rolling my eyes. The Arya storyline was quite good - the latter part was great (and faithful). The preceding murder of Meryn Trant was also a good piece of television except... did they really need to go to such lengths to demonstrate what a bad guy Meryn Trant is? This is the last place to go look for black and white morality. Arya wants revenge. You don't have to show us how justified it is. On the contrary, it would, I think, be much more powerful if we saw Meryn Trant being a nice guy and Arya still murdered him. The Meereen parts were a little meh. Nothing too spectacular, it's always good to see Varys even if his presence there seems a little convenient. Daenerys gets captures by a Khal, someone might have thought that since she was standing atop a high clifftop a few minutes before she would have seen a giant horde of Dothraki, but you'll say I'm overreacting. Cersei's walk of shame was a very powerful scene - though I dare say it was hard to fail at it, Lena Headey is a fine actress. I did see a subliminal self-criticism on the part of the show with the constant monotone of ""shame"".And then we have Jon Snow's murder (?). Finely handled as well, I won't complain (no Melisandre warning here of course, but doesn't matter). I suspect all those obvious hints with Ollie in previous episodes might have removed the surprise element for those who didn't know, but maybe not.All in all, I didn't really like season 5. Up until episode 8 it was certainly good but hardly compared to the previous years except for a few scenes (e.g. in Hardhome). Episode 9 was in my opinion a catastrophic, resounding failure on all levels of plot development. The finale uses a few of the book's climaxes to good effect but I am not sure a story so far removed and so poorly conceived at many of its original branches can stand."
209," Let's admit, that's why we love this show.
",10,True,"If this show followed the Hollywood trend of 'good guys always win' and 'main characters never die' then it would end up being just an average TV series with nice scenery. But those unexpected moments are why I and many others love this show. Because it's analogous to life, where anyone can die in the midst of a war, where the kings and heroes don't always die in glorious ways, where the most unexpected events can occur, where the people who shouldn't rule, rule for decades and those who show great potential, die in banal ways. It would be so nice to see Jon Snow alive and living up to his potential, it would be so nice to see Stannis take over Winterfell and save Sansa, it would be so nice to see Daenerys come back to Meereen all well and good. But would it?I think it's more like that sweet cake you'd love to eat, but once you eat it you realize it was a bad idea. Now you feel guilty and disappointed because you didn't foresee the long term implications. If those things did happen, it would end up being just another generic show. The moments that make us go 'I can't believe they just killed Jon Snow' are why we watch and love Game of Thrones!"
210," Wow...
",10,True,"Firstly, I would like to say that this is by no means a perfect episode and season for that matter, however this may be the most underrated episode of got as of season 5.
Now I'm watching got very late and I assume I'll be disappointed by the season 8 however I was gladly surprised by this episode and season 5 as a whole.
But the reason why I wanted to write a review for this episode in particular is due to the emotional rollercoaster I experienced. I don't think my emotions have ever changed so much in one episode of TV. From the great start with deaths of evil characters and the utter disgust you feel when cersi walks through the city and then finally at the end the death of Jon Snow. And I know he comes back to life somehow but that does not take away from the magnificence of this episode."
211," Love This Episode
",10,True,"Season 5, episode 10. Arya faces off with the many face god. Sansa and Theon escape Winterfell by jumping off it's tall walls. Stannis arrives at Winterfell and is defeated when Brienne faces him. The Red Woman makes her way back to the Castle Black. Jon is labeled a traitor. Jaime and Myrcella leave and head back to King's Landing. Cersei confesses a sin and is shamed all the way back to The Red Keep.Excellent episode - great cliff hangers!! 10/10"
212," The Red Woman
",10,True,"Most of the reviews you will read on here right now are biased reviews of people who read the novels before watching the show. Before the novel readers click away, take time to read this because it might be interesting to hear other people's opinions. When game of thrones started to stray away from the books in season 5 a group of people emerged on the internet that criticized and insulted the show for every little change of detail. These people take to their computers right after every episode and go on every website and give ratings unrealistically low because they are upset the show didn't happen exactly like the books. Unfortunately the books are very big and contain a lot of content so the TV show naturally can't include everything because of the lack of time. If everything was included it would take away from the important scenes in the show because they would have to be shortened to fit in all the little details and minor characters that have been cut out. And now unfortunately the show has caught up to the books and is surpassing them so when the TV show has no source material things are going to be fresh, new and slightly changed from the books because they have to start making things up on their own. So it is sad when Game of thrones is putting up higher quality television then most other shows out there but gets slammed and criticized by the novel readers just because the show was a little different and not what they expected. Seeing something unexpected is also the whole theme of game of thrones. Those people should be happy that they can watch an alternate story that is shocking and intriguing but will still end the same as the books instead of always knowing everything that is about to happen.To move on to the episode. No doubt it is different then the books but that is now a thing of the past because it has to be different. I read multiple negative reviews saying that nothing happened or too much build up or too much set up. I was shocked when I read those. So much happened in the episode, from the nights watch being divided over the murder of Jon snow, Sansa and Theon on the run to be saved by Brienne and Podrick with a good fight scene, Cersei and Jaime mourning their daughter talking about their past and their revenge filled future, foreshadowing with Margaery and the high sparrow, Tyrion and Varys talking strategy and then witnessing the burning of Daenerys' fleet, Daenerys meeting Khal Moro(I believe that was his name), Jorah and Daario finding their first clue, Arya reduced to begging on the streets and then gets abused by the waif, the shocking plot twist of the Sandsnakes and Ellaria killing Doran and Tristaine, and lastly, the episode ends with Melisandre revealing her true form which makes her an even more interesting and mysterious character. That is a lot of things that happened, each story line was compelling to watch and either had a twist, foreshadowing, action, or introduction to the problems a character will have to face this season. So I don't think you can say nothing happened. And for the people who said too much build up you must be expecting a red wedding every episode. It's the first episode of the season. There has to be build up and set up for the rest of the season. They can't just come out first episode and have Jon brought back to life, 3 main characters die, an insane battle, crazy fight scenes, and a shocking reveal. That would make the rest of the episodes in the season look really bad in comparison.I wrote this long review because I was dumbfounded with all the bad reviews and the reasons for them. People were getting mad and criticizing the show because what they wanted to happen didn't happen or the episode didn't have enough action or Jon snow didn't come back to life so they hated this episode. But that is how game of thrones has always been, not everything you want to happen happens which makes the show one of the most intriguing shows ever made. The show should not receive bad reviews for doing something that makes it good.Overall, this episode was the best premier yet. It had the perfect amount of action, twists, and set up (which is required in a premier) to get viewers interested and back into the show and excited for what comes next. So with all of that factored in and with being the first episode of the season, I give this episode a 10."
213," War is Coming
",8,True,"After months of speculation, reading dozens of optimistic articles, scavenging for set photos, and reading every David and Dan say in interviews, Game of Thrones has finally returned. While it's far from the eventful episodes that finished off season 5, 'The Red Woman' set up what's to come this season, and I think we are in for one of the best seasons of Thrones yet.We began back at Castle Black where season 5 left off, as Jon Snow lie dead after being murdered. As expected, Davos finds his body and with the help of a few Night's Watch members, brings his body to safety. I'm glad they spent a good amount of time at the wall because that's ultimately what everyone wanted. We didn't get any real answers in terms of a resurrection, but we have to believe it's coming, right? Sadly, it seems as if Melisandre has given up all hope on anything and everything (seriously WTF to that final scene).Sansa, Theon, and now Brienne seem to be heading to Castle Black in what will probably be the most gratifying storyline of season 6. With Sansa out of danger and doing things on her own terms I think it will be very satisfying seeing what she does in the North. We may be in for a war of the north type outcome with the Bolton's also on their way to The Wall. I just hope the road trip doesn't take place over the entire season and Sansa gets to Castle Black within a few episodes, thus having the battle be mid-season and at the latest the end of the season. If the show is only going to go 8 seasons, story lines need to pick up the pace a bit.Speaking of road trips, Jaime's trip to Dorne definitely didn't turn out the way he planned as it ended with the tragic death of Myrcella. As if Cersei wasn't already going to kill everyone who ever wronged her, this death may put her over the top. Tommen is likely not far from biting it himself. But hey, at least Doran Martell died right? The other 'shame' victim would be that of Margaery, although not nearly at as much fault as Cersei was. Much like Sansa's trip to Castle Black, I hope Margaery finds her way out of that cell sooner or later and we can get back to bada** Natalie Dormer. Though if Cersei has anything to say about it, her days will be numbered.Lastly, Arya and Daenerys made brief appearances as well. It seems Arya will be having the rough end to the stick for the majority of the season before she inevitably gets her sight back (to a certain extent). I can't say I know exactly where her story will be taken this season nor do I know if it will really relate to the bigger picture at all, but more Arya is usually the better. Daenerys on the other hand, is taking a step back from her progress towards Westeros. As Tyrion put it ""I don't think the queen will be heading to Westeros anytime soon"". I don't like the fact that she is now in captivity with another Khal and her ships are burnt to shreds. I want this season to end with her heading to Kings Landing, and that seems way out of the realm of possibility at this point.In all, it was a set up episode for all intents and purposes but it sucked me back into the world of Thrones, and I'm instantly stoked for next week. I'm hoping each story moves at a nice pace to get us at a great place at the end of season 6. Everything this season seems to be leading towards multiple battles/wars, and that's what we want to see. Plus, we are one step closer to Jon Snow returning (fingers crossed). On a side note, does anyone else want Ghost to tear Alliser Thorne's face off?+Spent a good chunk of time at the wall+Davos to the rescue+Brienne & Sansa!+Dany takes a stand-But the ships being burnt slows down her plans8.1/10"
214," Fundamental misunderstanding
",8,True,"I don't think some people actually understand what can be done during a season premiere.There are many character arcs and plot lines which must be planted and set up for the rest of the season. Season premieres are not meant to thrust you into the action of Hardhome or the heartbreak of the Red Wedding: they are meant to reintroduce you to the world of Westeros.And that is exactly what this episode achieved.Honestly, I was really impressed with this episode. We got to see almost all of the major characters, despite the relatively short run-time in comparison with other episodes.Sansa and Brienne have finally been brought together. It seems as though Sansa's come to her senses at last and realised that when a killing-machine like Brienne swears her allegiance to you, you don't say no. This is Game of Thrones. You win or you die, and Sansa's come pretty close to dying too many times already.Is there anything more satisfying than listening in on a conversation between two of the most intellectual and witty characters in Essos? Tyrion and Varys were brilliant together - as you'd imagine - and I can't wait to see how the two of them handle Meereen after the events of last season in the Daznak pit.I was completely caught off guard by Doran and Trystane being murdered. I don't think anybody quite expected that in the season premiere. This goes to show that Dan and Dave heard our criticisms last year of the Sandsnakes and Dorne, and have immediately gone straight for the jugular. The Sandsnakes are actually proving to be a threat and aren't giving stripteases in jail cells any longer.Cersei is going to kick ass this season. She's realised that the witch's prophecy is being fulfilled and in order to try to counteract it becoming a total reality she's going to become more protective over Tommen, her last surviving child, than a bear over her cubs.We got a brief introduction to Arya and witnessed how she's struggling with her latest problem. Last season Arya was in training, but left the training room too soon and was punished by the Many-Faced-God for it. Hopefully she'll be able to quickly learn from her mistakes and pick herself back up again soon.For a Khal, Khal Moro seems relatively respectful. I was half expecting him to behead Daenerys on the spot as soon as she hissed at him, yet he's clearly not like the other Khals.As you can see, this episode was quite impressive in the characters that it covered, but we are still yet to see Littlefinger, Bran, Sam, and some other new faces.I'd really like to see the trials of Margaery and Loras get underway soon, or at least let them be free by the Mother's Mercy as Cersei has been. Hearing that big oaf of a Septa saying ""confess"" incessantly is becoming rather tiresome. Also, please don't forget how action-packed the season five finale was. That episode was so dense that this episode was necessary to tie up what happened last season.Were some people expecting to see Jon jump up from the table or something? If you were paying attention in last season's finale, you'd have noticed how sullen and defeated Melisandre looked. Why? Because everything she thought she saw she didn't. She was so confident in herself - in her visions - and she was wrong. She is in turmoil, and it's going to take some incredible motivation to convince her that Jon is their only hope for survival. Just look at the final scene of the episode: she stripped away all of her clothing and magic and revealed her true self, which is something she's never done before and she'd only do if she felt utterly hopeless. Once she's found herself and she's committed to serving the Lord of Light again, then we can hope to see something happen with Jon.All in all, I'm thrilled with how this episode turned out. It did exactly what a season premiere aims to achieve, and more."
215," Hmmmmm Not all bad, But not all good.
",7,False,"Right to kick this off I should say I am and have been a BIG fan of the show since the start and I also have read all the books. That being said I appreciate the boundaries a TV show has and that changes are inevitable and up until season 5 I thought they managed the adaptation extremely well.Now, last season i had a couple of issue with a few plots (or absence of) the main one being the Stannis story and his demise. But nonetheless I decided to look past it and try again. In this episode we see a fair bit of story at the wall and I enjoyed those parts and believe it is, at the moment the most interesting part of the show, including things north of the wall. I even enjoyed Dannys parts and believe they bring some early season memories back. Now to Dorne. There is no way for me to describe how pointless the introduction of Dorne and the Dornish story line has been made after this episode. Essentially all the story and plot advances that the characters in Dorne offered in the novels has been scrapped and have been turned into cannon fodder. It seems like such a waste of what could have been so much better. the fact that the Martels' have now been wiped out is ridiculous to me, one of the 7 most powerful houses in Westeros gone. to me that was purely for shock value and a BIG waste of a good opportunity. The final reveal of Melisandre was done pretty well and will probably prove important to future plot points.All in all a DECENT start to the season with a lot of good points but let down drastically by some sloppy story. Personally I get the feeling they are trying to rush to the finish line now, and in that have lost a lot of the finesse that made people fall in love with this show. 7/10 for now and we'll see how the rest of the season goes"
216," Strong start to season
",9,True,"Good strong start to season. Start off right where it left off last season.No super crazy turn of events. A few deaths, few twists - like regular Game of Thrones.Red woman provided an interesting surprise, wait till the end of the episode for that.Theon Greyjoy showed promise. The episode sowed the seed for Theon to grow into someone stronger over the season.Looks like Arya will go through a lot of training this will season.We saw into the lives of all the major characters. Daenerys might be in some trouble at the Dothraki camp, Drogon hopefully will be back soon to save her.Brienne was wonderful, we fell in love with her AGAIN!! As expected Castle Black is where the episode started and ended. And should play a major part in the next few episodes to come as well. Looks like a fight is brewing up there, wait till next episode to see that."
217," Slow plot progression, but a good start
",8,True,"Last night, I saw the season premiere of Game of Thrones and from what I've got, it's really good. There are two problems I do have with this episode. I'm not going to spoil anything to those who haven't seen it, so I'm just going to point out the flaws and positive aspects.The plot progression does get very slow and didn't advance some of the story lines left by the fifth season. Also, some of the characters were given little to do and weren't fleshed out enough. Maybe things will get better throughout the sixth season, but only time will tell. For now, everything else turned out fine.The performances are still good, especially Lena Headey who shines with her emotional performance, the script is fine for the most part, the directing is very solid, the scenery is still gorgeous, the sets and costumes are still lavish to look at, and the music score from Ramin Djawadi is very beautiful. So, overall, not great, but a good start to Season 6. :)"
218," ""Is her ***** hair white too?""
",5,False,"This episode was wildly underwhelming with realistically zero plot progression. I mean, in the span of 60 minutes all we saw were things already revealed in the trailer and nothing else. Let me start by listing a few grievances.What was the point in giving Brienne the ultimatum last season b/w choosing to kill Stannis or saving Sansa? I mean usually the whole point of an ultimatum is that one thing is accomplished while another thing is abandoned, hence the point of an ultimatum. But no, Brienne the Deus Ex Machina is able to kill both Stannis, and conveniently arrive in the nick of time to save Sansa and Theon to help her gain more fan approval. Please give me a break.Then they completely butchered Dorne's story line past the point of redemption. I was actually looking forward to how Doran would deal with the upcoming conflict that is bound to happen with the Lannisters. He is also one of my favourite and most enjoyable book characters. Instead, they completely butcher his character arc in favour of the sand snakes!? ARE YOU KIDDING ME!?And then we have some really questionable dialogue. I mean ""Is her ***** hair white too?"" ARE YOU KIDDING ME!? That has to be on par with ""you want a good girl but need a bad *****"" line from last season.I was also looking forward to the introduction of iron islands and Bran but I guess there is only so much they can fit into an episode.The only reason why this gets a five from me is because it is still better quality TV than the vast majority of Television shows I've seen recently (I'm looking at you ""The Walking Dead""). I mean, if you haven't read the books, than this episode was probably gold and you could care less about my opinion. But being someone who loves the novels from which the show is adapted, I can't help but feel a little let down and you have to try and understand where I'm coming from.All in all, this was a pretty disappointing premier. This will probably be flagged down by everyone who can't take a little but of constructive criticism. But hey, if you read my review I thank you for your time."
219," Best ""First episode"" of any season
",9,True,"Usually Game of Thrones start in first gear and usually pick up speed. But in season 6, they directly started in fourth gear. They started with all guns blazing bang bang. The episode touched upon almost all the sub-plots.The best moment for was when Cersei broke down in front of Jamie (not in a sadistic manner). In that moment a character as strong as Cersei started believing in prophecies. This showed her humane side. Because like all of us she also start believing in prophecies, Gods and monsters in our darkest times. Couldn't have asked for a better start of the show!!"
220," ""I saw him in the flames, fighting at Winterfell.""
",8,True,"If you look back on previous seasons, Melisandre has been given an exclusive preview of various plot developments but like any classic 'tinfoil theory' on a message board, has misinterpreted them. Despite this, the ending of this destined to be classic episode is a window into Melisandre's true powers and tells us that while human vice has threatened her clarity of perception, she does have a divine purpose as her centuries old survival proves. Perhaps those who doubted that Melisandre's blood magic ritual in Season 3 could have set the Red and Purple Wedding events in motion will now reconsider the vital role of this character in clearing the chessboard for the true war to commence. With all of these engrossing plot lines in motion, it seems to me that characters like Melisandre and Bran Stark have always served as the essential players in a much deeper story, so whilst the Littlefingers and Varyses manipulate the game of thrones, Melisandre envisions the song of ice and fire in which the great game will eventually be consumed. Through actions both hideous (the sacrifice of Shireen) and heroic (her validation of Jon Snow), Melisandre has moved through the series as a serene constant: highly organised and efficient and inured by an enormous responsibility. With her elegant gravitas, Carice van Houten has manifested the mystical potency of this saga as few others could and if the ending of this stunning episodes proves anything, it is that she has excelled in making the mythical heart of the story come alive for us all."
221," Disappointing, dull and unbelievable.
",1,False,"This review does contain spoilers.First of all, I'll just say I was excited as anyone to get back to watching Game of Thrones, after months of following the casting, set photos and interviews. After a lackluster Season Five, I was hoping that the show would return to the wonderful television contained within the first few seasons.Obviously, it's too early to judge the season as a whole but this episode was absolutely abysmal. Though we are provided with some quality acting from Alfie Allen, Lena Headey, Liam Cunningham, Conleth Hill and Carice van Houten, like we have come to expect, the rest of the main cast is consistently dull and lifeless, especially Emilia Clarke. Even the best of performances are brought down by boring, unremarkable dialogue. The locations are as pretty as ever, but I've never been one to take style over substance, and this episode is severely lacking in anything resembling substance. Let's begin with the dialogue. In this episode, it generally comes across as very forced and unnatural. For example, after Arya is called ""blind girl"" by the Waif, Arya remarks that she can't see. Is that what blind means? The episode is just full of dialogue that seems like it was written for a storyboard; there to fill an explicit purpose but not actually bring anything substantial or meaningful to the table.Another example of terrible dialogue that stands out is ""Do you think she has white pussy hair?"" This scene, like the rest of Daenerys' scenes (and Arya's for that matter)is a waste of screen-time and intellectually insulting. I don't watch TV for two characters to discuss the color of someone's pubic hair, for one thing, and then two minutes later we're supposed to believe that Daenerys was unharmed for hundreds of miles of travel. Of course, that's the last thing I wanted, but nonetheless it's so inconsistent that it's absolutely absurd.This is my main problem with this episode: it's wildly unbelievable and internally inconsistent, even for a show with ice zombies and dragons. Are we really expected to believe that Brienne and Pod find Sansa and Theon JUST IN THE NICK OF TIME? Are we really expected to be shocked at yet another ""good guy kills bad guy from behind right before other good guy gets killed""? Are we really expected to believe that the Sand Snakes followed Trystane all the way to King's Landing to murder him in cold blood, for little to no reason? Don't forget they watched his ship sail at the end of Season Five. Are we really expected to believe that the Sons of the Harpy would prevent Daenerys' forces from leaving Meereen, despite trying to overthrow her? Are we really expected to believe that Ellaria would kill Oberyn's nephew and brother as an extension of their revenge against the Lannisters? The characters of Doran and Trystane are ended before we really get to see them in action, for, again, no reason. Would Oberyn care for his immediate kin being murdered? Are we really expected to believe that the fit Areo Hotah instantly dies to a backstab, yet the gouty Doran can survive to talk after being stabbed in the chest? Are we really expected to believe that Jaime has actually regressed as a character, instead of being humbled at the loss of a hand and the degradation of his relationship with his sister? I have more, but you get the point.All of this is crammed into a very short episode, and none of it goes on long enough to warrant a proper reaction, even if any of it made sense. It all seems as if the writers have suddenly decided that ""X must happen at any cost, people will eat it up, so there's no need to make it coherent"".This being said, there ARE some good moments, too. The ending Melisandre scene was great, so was Davos holed up with Edd, Jon's corpse and Ghost. Tyrion and Varys have a great dynamic as always, but, all in all, the episode is dragged down by some serious, unforgivable flaws that must be immediately corrected if the show is to ever reach anything close to greatness again. As it stands, it seems unpolished, unplanned, unbelievable."
222," A promising season opener
",8,True,"Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.Although it is a long way from being the best, or one of the best, season openers for 'Game of Thrones', Season 6 starts off very promisingly. It is easy to see why it has been positively reviewed by critics but also why it is divisive among fans and book fans. It does depart from the source material, especially in its treatment of Doran, even though somebody who always judges adaptations on their own terms not doing anything further with such an interesting character in the source material with more to give was a missed opportunity. There are certainly far better episodes in the season and of 'Game of Thrones' in general, but to me ""The Red Woman"" was very good, though with a couple of reservations. ""The Red Woman"" is at its weakest with the Dorne storyline. It was one of the biggest problems with the previous season and there is not much improvement. It is not particularly interesting and some of it is even cartoonish. Even more disappointing was its cheap treatment of Doran, one that was very rushed and abrupt and he deserved better.With such a lot going on in terms of story and character interaction, ""The Red Woman"" definitely would have benefitted from either being longer as an episode or having the events spread out as a two parter or something. Parts did feel hasty and it would perhaps have made the Dorne storyline better. A huge amount works here however. Character interaction-wise, faring best are Jaime and Cersei and in particular Sansa and Brienne, both intense and poignant. Loved what was done with Daenerys, even though brief, and felt sorry too for Arya. Davos shining more than he has been in a while was a plus as well. Another standout is the shock Melisandre reveal, that was harrowing. It is an episode that isn't action-heavy and doesn't advance existing storylines, with the main question on everyone's lips from ""Mother's Mercy"" being answered early on, but it sets up what is to follow well. 'Game of Thrones' has not faltered in the acting stakes and there is not a single bad performance. Standout performances are Lena Headey, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, Emilia Clarke and Maisie Williams, while Carice Van Houten gives her best acting to date.Visually, ""The Red Woman"" looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about ""The Red Woman"" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.The writing is thought-provoking and there are no embarrassing lines this time (certainly not on the same level as that Sand Snake line in ""Mother's Mercy"". The storytelling mostly is passionate and sensitive, underwhelming only in Dorne. Overall, promising and very good. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
223," A solid start to Season Six
",8,True,"As the sixth season gets underway we are shown what is happening to most of the protagonists. It is quickly confirmed that Jon Snow is definitely dead; Ser Davos and his allies at Castle Black must decide what to do next; knowing that Ser Alliser and the other members of the Watch who killed Jon will surely kill them too. Sansa and Theon are caught by Bolton troops but are then rescued by Brienne of Tarth and Podrick. Cersei vows to get revenge for the death of her daughter. Ellaria Sand and her Sand Snakes stage a coup in Dorne. Daenerys is the captive of Dothraki. Arya Stark is blind and begging on the streets when forced to fight an assailant who promises to fight her again the next day. Tyrion observes that tensions are high in Meereen before he sees the ships in the harbour ablaze.This episode might not be full of action but there are some moments; most notably when Brienne rescues Sansa but also some shocking moments of violence in Dorne. The way we only get brief glimpse of what happened to some characters may disappoint some viewers, especially those watching it straight after season five, however, having not watched season five for almost a year, I found this did what was required to reintroduce me to what had been happening without actually wasting time on a recap. There are also solid hints at what is likely to be happening later in the season and a surprising revelation about Melisandre, the titular 'Red Woman'. Overall a fine episode that quickly brought me back to the world of the 'Game of Thrones' and keen to see what happens in the rest of the series."
224," bad very bad start
",5,False,"This show is really going downhill. Almost nothing is working good in this 6th season premiere. The script is more and more unlikely and illogical. Dorne is still cartoonish and pointless. The killing of Trystane was ridiculous. Where are those two sandsnakes coming from? A boat sneaking unseen in King's Landing harbor, out of nowhere? Roose Bolton speech, fearing for the Lannisters to come against the North, was pointless: the issue definitely should have been arisen before. At the Wall: the public explanation for Lord Commander's killing was weak and definitely unconvincing, since the wildlings had already come in. What was Jon's murder aimed to avoid, at that point? Weak and meaningless. And what the hell are Davos, Edd and the other guys doing with Jon's corpse? Are they barricaded to defend Jon's dead body? Why on earth? Because they are expecting him to resurrect? Never heard of anything like that as a reaction to someone's death. Never. And Sansa, North's blood, who is afraid of a cold river when Ramsey's dogs are barking behind her? In Essos too, everything looks messy: where did Drogon end up? Vanished into nothing? The entire horde with thousands of Dothraki couldn't see him? But what's worse is that the dialogs are dull and boring, uninteresting. The pace is boring. This is the long awaited first episode and already many scenes sound like fillers. The charm, the subtlety and the brilliancy of the first seasons is gone. No confidence in what's coming."
225," Not a review.
",8,True,"Just wanted to correct something, one of the goofs states that when Jon's eyes are closed his fingers move. Those weren't his fingers, they were Eddison Tollet's fingers because just prior to closing his eyes he put his hand on Jon's chest where the blood was."
226," A good start to the season.
",9,True,"This seasons start begins the story well with new and unexpected events. I feel a tad underwhelmed with some of it, however I feel there is so much more to come. As usual, I am left dangling with the future of characters and revelations brought by the end of the episode, with hope for more to come. First episode of the season, and I'm intrigued by what I'm seeing. Now that we've left the realm of the books, (I will admit I've yet to finish the 4th book of late), and now the story may or may not be true to what Martin wants the story to go. It still carried the weight of what has already been brought to the screen and I would like to think they will continue to do the series justice. Season 5 was rather weak in certain places so Season 6 should hopefully rise to the occasion."
227," Going downhill
",4,False,"This show is really going downhill. Almost nothing is working good in this 6th season premiere. The script is more and more unlikely and illogical. Sansa and Theon obviously got to make that huge jump from the wall unharmed. Then Sansa, North's blood, is afraid of a cold river while Ramsey's dogs are barking behind her. Bolton hounds magically disappear the precise instant they find Sansa. Then Brienne arrives, who easily save the day by killing off all the (6? 7? 8?) Bolton soldiers. Dorne is still cartoonish and pointless. As a remedy for the lack of agency shown by prince Doran versus the Lannisters (who had killed some beloved members of Martell family), they decide to kill all the remaining line of the Martells. After such an unlikely coup, they clearly plan to move at war against the Lannisters, in order to avenge some of the Martells (Elia and Oberyn, who actually died in a trial by combat). Seriously? The circumstances of the coup are completely insane and not worthy mention. The killing of Trystane was also ridiculous. Where are those two sandsnakes coming from? A boat sneaking unseen in King's Landing harbor, out of nowhere? The confrontation inside the ship, with Trystane's death, is very badly executed, with a ridiculous final sentence by one of the snakes (""Greedy pussy"", the bar hasn't got much higher since the ""bad pussy"" line fro season 5). Roose Bolton speech, fearing for the Lannisters to come against the North, was pointless: the issue definitely should have been arisen before. At the Wall: Ghost's howling, just a few minutes after the murdering, immediately summons Davos and the other guys (who couldn't hear any noise during the lengthy ""for the watch"" sequence, but suddenly run at Ghost's howl). Jon's friends are all at once gathered, and no one else, around Jon's corpse. They immediately know they are the only few loyal brothers. They don't ever bother attending the general meeting. The public explanation for Lord Commander's killing was weak and definitely unconvincing, since the wildlings had already come in. What was Jon's murder aimed to avoid, at that point? What was supposed to be the plan? Taking the wildlings back beyond the Wall? Calling northern houses to engage a battle against the wildlings sitting in the Gift? Weak, pointless plan. And what the hell are Davos, Edd and the other guys doing with Jon's corpse? Are they barricaded to defend Jon's dead body? Why on earth? Because they are expecting him to resurrect? Never heard of anything like that as a reaction to someone's death. Never. In Essos too, everything looks messy: where did Drogon end up? Vanished into nothing? The entire horde with thousands of Dothraki couldn't see him? How come the entire fleet is burnt in a few seconds? Was it left unguarded? But what's worse is that many of the dialogs are dull and boring, uninteresting. The pace is boring. This is the long awaited first episode and already many scenes sound like fillers. The charm, the subtlety and the brilliancy of the first seasons is gone. No confidence in what's coming."
228," Many Segments, Short Running Time
",7,False,"John Snow is dead and his friend Davos grieves his death. Sansa and Theon are hunted down by Ramsay's knights, but out of the blue, Brienne and Podrick save them. Cersei is waiting for her beloved daughter Myrcella and Jaime brings her corpse instead. Margaery Tyrellis wants to have news about her brother and when she is going to be tortured, High Sparrow interrupts the session. In Dorne, Ellaria and the Sand Snakes betray and kill Doran Martell and his son Trystane. Daenerys Targaryen is made prisoner of a Dothraki horde. Tyrion and Lord Vaeys are walking around in Meereen watching the people posing of merchants. Something strange happens with Melisandre. The return of ""Game of Thrones"" with ""The Red Woman"" shows many segments but along a short running time. The segments with Sansa and Doran are the best ones and the conclusion of the show is intriguing with the old woman. The other segments do not show anything new and are just to introduce the return of the characters. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""The Red Woman"""
229," Moving Toward a Center
",8,True,"I'm fascinated by people who expect every episode to be full of fights and encounters. Remember, when all is said and done, this is a single story. Lord of the Rings had to have ""The Two Towers"" to get to the ending. We have several key figures moving into new directions with all moving toward an unspecified center. We know for sure that Theon is regaining his humanity, acting heroically. Sansa is with him and alive and a pawn in the game, but necessary. Cersei is back at the castle. We are still in the dark about how much power she has. How have these religious fanatics affected the empire. The new queen is in the dungeon, being asked to confess. Dany finds herself in the hands of a warrior society similar to the one she left when becoming mother of dragons. The princess returns to the castle with Jaime, dead. And back home the evil women have formed a coup and murdered the bridegroom and his father. Arya is totally blind and is beaten with a wooden rod and asked to defend herself. I'm sure her role will come into focus again. And, of course, Brienne and Pod come to the rescue of the escapees and they swear their allegiance to Sansa once again. She now has purpose again and is a worthy foe to anyone. I, myself, am not even slightly disappointed with the setup. Have some patience, people."
230," Producers just don't care with logic anymore
",1,False,"Where the hell were Davos and Jon's friends at the time of his death? They didn't hear anything? REALLY?Bolton's men destroyed Stannis' camp last season but couldn't fight Brienne and Pod? Really?Sand Snakes killing Doran, Areo Hotah and Trystane and that's fine? Where are the dornish army? REALLY?With the Martell now extinct, who is going to rule Dorne? Bastards? REALLY?Martell is the second family to be completely extinct by the producers. We've already said goodbye to Baratheons.Daenerys keeps getting ""special writing treatment"". Do you really think a horde of dothraki would do nothing to her only because she was Drogo's wife? OK then.That Melisandre scene. Unnecessary. The old clichê of the beautiful witch who is actually an old hag.There is no ""game of thrones"" anymore. No political schemes. No conspiracy. The game is over. And it got replaced with an awful fan-fiction."
231," Not good when ""average"" or normal enter your GoT description
",8,True,"While still way above other TV shows in quality, GoT is slowly drifting from the epic GRRM storytelling to the eternal Deus Ex Machina for TV Shows.The season premiere is predictable, pretty much uneventful (except for the closing scene) and is desperately trying to make us care for characters that simply have not had a good construction arc since their introduction. Tyrion and Varys steal the show for me though, I love 'em power couple.Defined in four words: your average GoT episode... and for a work inspired in ASOIF, I think that is not OK."
232," Awful
",1,False,"The 'Sand Snakes' alone brought this episode down completely. The writers seem to be pandering to the lowest common denominator with numerous short scenes where little of consequence happens, and the favourite characters banter back and forth with cringe worthy dialogue. It is clear that HBO producers don't expect their audience to understand anything subtle or interesting at all, and so have reduced the formula to: people die, people copulate, people have short vapid exchanges. The only way they could redeem the show for me now is for the next episode to be a 60 minute sequence of the Sand Snakes being hung, drawn and quartered in vivid detail."
233," Ugh
",1,False,"With 6.1 Game of Thrones has officially gotten to the point where I feel like everything has screeched to a halt. The first few seasons of the show were some of the best television ever made, and with S5 and from the looks of the first episode of this season the formula is getting stale. We get 40 minutes per episode of nothing happening followed by 5 minutes of mediocre ending with 2 minutes of excellent. With only 1 good episode per season since 4 I'm beginning to feel like watching this show is nothing but a chore. Not to mention the glaring continuity errors and plot holes this one episode had. Game of Thrones, you used to be good. What happened?"
234," Quick pacing and strong character framework kicks off a new Game of Thrones season
",7,False,"I have to be honest; I was scared going into this episode. Not because of any emotional connection to Jon Snow as a character or his story, but simply because the show's last season was so bumpy that my faith as a viewer slipped a bit. I was scared that the show would resurrect Jon in this opening episode, ruining any kind of narrative direction that it could have earned otherwise. Thank the Gods, then, that by the end of ""The Red Woman"" Jon Snow is still very much dead. His death shook each and every viewer invested in the show, but for that impact to carry through into the new season we needed to understand how his death affects the people of Westeros as well, and that's exactly what this episode does. We see a broken Edd, devastated by the loss of a true friend. We have Ser Davos, a man whose new found loyalty has been shaken and whose purpose in the narrative is now at question again. Finally, we have Melisandre; the Red Woman herself. Jon's death hits her the hardest. Melisandre has had every ounce of her faith stripped from her over this episode and the season five finale, and ""The Red Woman"" allows us to truly see the impact this has on her. As she retreats to her chamber, she strips naked, removes her necklace, and we see the real her for the first time: a withered, ancient woman. It's a starkly beautiful sequence, as harrowing as it is surprising. Carice van Houten - one of my favourite performers on the show - gives arguably her best performance to date here. She is portrays this fragility masterfully.The Wall was home to a variety of excellent sequences in this premiere, but the majority of the other subplots fared equally well. Arya's brief check-in served its purpose of updating us as to where she is now, and finished with the promise of a similarly violent sequence next week. Cersei's gutting reaction to finding Myrcella was a highlight of the episode; I've always adored Lena Headey as a performer, but she truly excelled here. Watching her walk towards the docks to greet her daughter only to cut away to her in her chambers later in the day was heartbreaking, which is quite an accomplishment given some of the monstrous acts that Cersei has performed. I also really enjoyed our check in with Dorne this episode, which surprised me greatly due to how dull and lifeless the Dorne arc was last year. This time around, though, it was benefited by a rapid change in pace. Watching Ellaria Sand murder Prince Doran was undeniably shocking, but it also worked in really emphasising how much Ellaria believes in her cause. She is willing to commit treason to gain revenge for what happened to Oberyn two seasons ago, and I felt that I understood her purpose in the show more in that one sequence than her entire arc last year.Our brief time with Daenerys was also solid tonight. It's unusual seeing Dany in a vulnerable position after her consistent development into power over the last few years, but it works due to Emilia Clarke's committed performance and the inclination that she won't be in this position for very long. With two large dragons in captivity, and an even bigger one nesting nearby, it's hard to imagine the new Dothraki horde staying in control here: it will just be interesting to watch Dany work her way out of this. Some of the humour felt slightly forced in this story, and not a lot of it landed, but I can overlook a small quibble in an otherwise strong subplot. Brienne, Podrick, Sansa and Theon all also came together tonight in a thrilling sequence placed surprisingly early in the episode. This grouping of characters was easy to predict, but I have to admit to being surprised by how quickly this came about. I didn't expect Brienne to pledge herself to Sansa again until at least the midpoint of the season, so this quick pacing helped push along the episode in its earlier half.Pacing was a general strength of this entire episode, really. Most Game of Thrones premieres attempt little more than a catch up of the last season's bloodbath, but here ""The Red Woman"" was content to cover a lot more ground. Perhaps it is down to this pacing increase, then, that it feels as if the show is beginning its end game. A handful of characters are now in places that could launch them into their resolutions, and for the first time in the show's history it feels as if we're a long way into this long, long story. Game of Thrones benefited last year from a tighter hold on character thematics, and it seems likely that that will be kept this year too: every character, here, is focused on a situation they've found themselves in whilst working towards something else. It gives each sequence a sense of purpose in the long run, as if every character isn't really that far apart despite the fact that they're on different continents. If this strong thematic purpose can be coupled with some powerful narrative development and a handful of climactic sequences, then we could be in for a hell of year."
235," Good start to a hopefully spectacular season
",8,True,"The first episode of season 6 starts of right where season 5 left off. We see Jon Snow's dead body in the snow and we hear Ghost howling in the night. It's a good start for a hopefully spectacular season.+Melisandre plot twist - The humour - Peter Dinklage, Conleth Hill - Sansa, Theon, Brienne scene - Lena Headey's great acting_Dorne storyline wasted - Short episode - Some plot holes: disappearing hounds, magically appearing Sand Snakes, magically appearing Brienne, Melisandre without her necklace in season 4"
236," One of the best episodes so far!
",10,True,"After Season 6 Episode 1's criticism for being uneventful, we get the exact opposite for Episode 2. The action, witty lines, emotional scenes, and revelations that we all love about Game of Thrones come together in one masterpiece of an episode. Three Eyed Raven: Bran's storyline is the most interesting of this episode and gave us the show's first major flashback. We see a glimpse of young Stark children, all of which are assumed to be dead. Little Ned is training and even smaller Benjen, while we get our first look at Lyanna Stark as she taunts her brother with horse riding skills. Lyanna is one of the biggest and most important characters (along with Rhaegar and Aerys) that died before the story takes place. Bran also sees a young Hodor, who's name is actually Willis, with capable speech and etiquette. Could his change be related to Lyanna's death, who he seemingly had a good relationship with?King's Landing: Myrcella's funeral takes place, which Cersei is banned from by Tommen due to fear of her being arrested again. Jaime, before engaging in a confrontation with the High Sparrow, persuades Tommen to talk to his mother. They then share an emotional scene in which Tommen asks Cersei to help him become stronger, and she replies ""Always"". Could foreshadow Tommen adapting his mother's personality.Iron Isles: Balon Greyjoy becomes infuriated at Yara and blames her for their recent defeats. They have a heated conversation before Balon is secretly killed by Euron Greyjoy, his brother, by throwing him off a rickety bridge into stormy waters. The North: Sansa engages in conversation with Brienne about Arya, who informs her of Arya's time with Sandor Clegane. Theon apologizes to Sansa in a brief display of his old self, and acknowledges that he betrayed Robb and the rest of the Stark family. After deciding to march to the wall and seek Jon Snow's help, Theon contemplates going back home to the Iron Isles. Meanwhile, Roose and Ramsay Bolton are considering storming the Wall to kill Jon Snow and recapture Sansa, as the maester of Winterfell announces that Walda Frey has gave birth to a boy. Ramsay congratulates his father, then proceeding to stab his father in the stomach after the false display of affection, killing him and declaring himself ""Lord Bolton"". Ramsay feeds Walda and his newborn half-brother to his hounds.Braavos: Arya fails another training lesson. After she is visited by Jaqen H'ghar, and tells her that if she says her name she will be given her vision back. Arya says ""no one"" multiple times, seemingly passing the test.Mereen: Tyrion, Varys, Grey Worm and Missandei discuss the recent terror attacks within Meereen. Tyrion provides the episode with its bit of humor when he makes ""no cock"" jokes to poke fun at Varys. He decides to let Rhaegal and Viserion out of their binds, despite the concerns of Daenerys' other advisers. Tyrion reveals that he was fascinated with dragons at a young age. The Wall: This is where the episode's action takes place. Ser Davos and Jon's other supporters prepare for a battle after refusing to hand his body over. Before Alliser Thorne breaks down the door a part of the Wilding army, led by Tormund and a giant, barge in the front gate and make the Night's Watch surrender. After showing TOrmund the dead body of his friend, Davos asks Melisandre if there is a possibility of resurrecting Jon. He tells her that all the gods ""can go f themselves"", and reinstates her faith within herself, if not her religion. After a ritual involving Jon's hair, Melisandre, Davos, Ed and Tormund leave the room in disappointment, believing that it failed. Once the door is shut, Ghost stirs, and Jon awakes wide-eyed and gasping for air.This was an amazing episode. It showed us the death of two powerful rulers belonging to two powerful houses, a glimpse at Lyanna Stark and the resurrection of a beloved character (my personal favourite), Jon Snow. This had to be one of the 10 greatest episodes that have been released so far, as it embodies everything we love about Game of Thrones: Emotional and dramatic conversations, plot twists, violence, comedy, major deaths and triumphs of a loved character. Although sex may cause boosts in ratings and makes many scenes greater, this episode is evidence that Game of Thrones is much more than ""Tits and Dragons""."
237," Out-bloody-standing
",10,True,"This episode was fantastic, one of the best of the series so far. There are so many twists in the plot this episode, ending on a very high note.First of all, the writing here is brilliant, with the story heading in a great direction. This episode was also fast paced, with a lot happening within its runtime. I expected many events that occurred during the episode to take place down the line, but I am glad they did it to begin with, because I can't wait to see what happens next.The sets, the production, bringing us back to meet our old characters, Bran for a start, was a joy to see. And how he has grown!This season really looks like it is going to be spectacular, with these two new episodes it is starting off to be the best season yet. 10/10 brilliant episode."
238," Now this is excellent television.
",8,True,"After what was (in my opinion) a bit of a slow premier, episode 2 took the pent up momentum and delivered us a magnificent viewing experience. I enjoy how we're starting to see Bran dabble in flashbacks, Bran quickly became one of my favorite story lines after a weak few first seasons. The scene with Ramsay helped to further develop his character, giving us yet another scene that is emotionally devastating and difficult to watch. It was also rewarding to see Theon finally express that feeling of being redeemed, his scene with Sansa was moving and sincere. Also, can't get through a review without giving them props for really delivering on making Robert Strong a frightening, physically imposing, remorseless character.Now onto the final scene. I've never seen Game of Thrones as the sort of show to deliver ""fan service"", and while at first glance it looks like reviving Jon Snow would be the ultimate fan service, it definitely did not feel as such. Jon Snow's return felt like the natural next step to take in the Castle Black storyline. This episode has done a phenomenal job furthering several story lines and giving us something to look forward to next week. Great work, D&D."
239," Two shocking departures and a 'surprising' return
",10,True,"This episode opens north of the wall as we see Bran Stark for the first time since season four; he is being tutored in his skills and sees into the distant past to a time when his father was a child and Hodor could speak. Further south the traitors of the Night's Watch move to kill Ser Davos and his men but just as they strike a Wildling force arrives from the south and the tables are turned. In Meereen Tyrion frees the two remaining dragons from their chains. Cersei is kept from seeing the body of her daughter while High Sparrow stands up to Jaime Lannister. In Winterfell Ramsay murders his father and worse. On the Iron Islands the king is murdered.This episode got off to a fine start; I'd almost forgotten about Bran, he'd been out of the show for so long; his reintroduction was well handled and raised some interesting questions about Hodor and what happened to his aunt. The other highlights of the show were the events at Winterfell and on the Iron Islands; the death of Roose Bolton at the hands of his son was a shock but not half as disturbing as what Ramsay did to his step mother and new baby half-brother. With one leader dead I certainly didn't expect the death of Balon Greyjoy moments later. The show's finale should have been equally surprising but unfortunately it was impossible to avoid spoilers about Jon Snow's resurrection so it was just a question of which episode he would actually return in even so the scene was well handled. While the other scenes weren't quite as dramatic as these I still found them interesting and at no point did I feel that anything we were shown was unneeded. Overall a quality episode that was definitely a step up from the season opening, which I also enjoyed. I'm definitely keen to see what happens next."
240," This season is moving much faster than excepted.
",10,True,"***CONTAINS SPOILERS*** *********************** Amazing episode. In just the second episode of the season things pick up dramatically. A very cool flashback through one of bran's visions appears it will reveal something major that has been theorized for years. Castle black gets dramatic between the mutineers and the help that arrives. Sir Robert Strong AKA the zombie mountain appears he will be a very useful tool for Cersei's revenge tear that appears to be on the horizon. Ramsay surprises though many of us saw this coming with instances of foreshadowing, though still shocking to see. The iron islands makes a nice return to season 6. Tyrion was shortly featured but had a very awesome scene with creatures I hope to see him in the presence of more in the future. A character that has spoken one word the entire series has spoken others. Oh and that thing that we all kind of knew was going to happen, happened. Though I was certain it would happen (at least in my own mind), I was still on the edge of my seat the for the entire last scene of the episode thinking they may wait. Once the episode ended and I watched the episode 3 promo, I became super upset that I have to wait a week because it looks like it is showing a scene that has been theorized about since the late 90's. This season isn't f***ing around. Things are moving fast and the entire story is in new territory past the books (for the most part)."
241," Incredible!
",10,True,"What an episode!!! Right from the start S6E02 looked set to be one hell  of an hour, and it turned out to not only be a great episode, but one  of the best in the show's 6 seasons. Honestly I am still sitting here  shaking after the credits have long finished, and it 3am here in bloody  England! This is the episode that we have all been waiting for.  Ramsay (Iwan Rheon) reminds us how twisted and evil he is, by killing  not one, but three, three (!) of his family members in the space of 5  minutes. His father Roose (Michael McElhatton) is the first to kick the  bucket, in sickening style, before the vile and sickening deaths of  Walda Bolton (Elizabeth Webster) and his newborn baby brother. Ramsay  officially makes Joffrey look like a decent bloke. But that is why we  love him.  There are of course some other memorable moments including great scenes  with Arya (Maisie Williams) and Theon (Alfie Allen), but near the end  of the episode we saw the much anticipated debut of Euron Frickin  Greyjoy (Pilou Asbaek) in spectacular fashion after he throws his older  brother and King of the Iron Islands Balon Greyjoy (Patrick Malahide)  over the bridge that all book readers like myself have been waiting to  see.   And finally. finally! After almost a year of speculation, and after all  hope seemed lost, Jon Snow woke his lazy behind up! He's back! I love how  HBO handled this whole storyline, I began the season feeling positive  that he would return, but after last weeks episode, I must admit I lost  faith. Melisandre (Carice Van Houten) tries but seemingly fails to  bring Jon (Kit Harington) back at Ser Davos' (Liam Cunningham) request.  But it is after everyone leaves the room where Jon's body lay, that the  episodes biggest moment happens. Jon opens his eyes whilst panting,  trying to get an idea of his surroundings. Then the camera cuts  straight to credits. It gave me goosebumps, that half an hour later,  are still here.  'Home' is a superb episode and it has set the standards for Season 6 of  this incredible show even higher; a perfect 10/10 for S6E02!  Performance of the week: Iwan Rheon (Ramsay Bolton) Honourable Mention:  Kit Harington (Jon Snow) We've missed you Kit!"
242," Everything we've ever been waiting for happening all at once.
",10,True,"Whenever I watch this show, I turn in to a whimpering baby. Game of Thrones is, in terms of literature, the next Lord of The Rings. It's the epic complex fantasy series that gets scrutinized in all its wonderful detail by a massive community. And yet what makes Game of Thrones somewhat unique is that the adaptation is coming out while the story is still unfinished. Enough of the book version came out before the show that people were able to develop this deep fascination and speculation about the lore, but now the show is ahead of the books. As a result, being a book reader triples my investment in the show; these are the characters I have been analyzing and following for years; this is the result of their story, suddenly playing itself out in a weekly format where anything can happen. It's wonderful, terrifying, and exhilarating. True, it can also result in disappointment (such as last week's Dorne plot). But when an episode like this one, or last season's Hardhome comes along, viewing it is an experience like no other. Every scene leaves you hanging on a knife's edge. And with that in mind, let's begin.At the start of the episode, we (FINALLY) catch up with Bran. We see that he and the Three Eyed Raven are deep in vision. We then cut to that vision, where we see a young Ned and Benjen stark practising in the courtyard of Winterfell. The way it is shot is a replica of the scene in the pilot where young Bran practised in the same spot. This highlights the fact that Bran was simply following the path of every young Stark that came before him, adding an extra dimension to the pilot. And now, in the vision, Bran and the Three Eyed Raven stand where Ned and Catelyn stood in the pilot, underlining how far Bran has come. The scene sets up some things for the reveal of Jon Snow's parents, and introduces a young Hodor. We begin to see the tragic story of Hodor, making me feel bad for taking part in the internet's loving mocking of him. When we return to the cave, we see that the makeup artists have worked more on the Children's look, and Meera feels lonely.At Castle Black, the battle that was setup in the last episode plays itself out. The result was satisfying but slightly confusing; how did Davos and the others contact the Wildlings?Roose Bolton's child is born, and Ramsay does something unexpected. I mean truly unexpected. I expected it to happen eventually, but not now. It is actually pretty satisfying, until he gets to the second part of his plan. That's when it becomes so brutal that I had trouble watching. I really hope he dies this season.Theon departs. It's kind of sad, kind of cathartic. Where is he going?We get a scene with the common folk in King's Landing. It is legitimately good to catch up with them; I always like seeing the underbelly of the big events in the plot. It also leads to a Franken-Mountain moment that makes one unsure whether to laugh, wince, or cry. I settled for a wince. Myrcella's funeral happens (is it technically even a funeral if there is no ceremony and only two people show up?). Jaime and the High Sparrow have a stare down. Tommen has a touching scene.Ary- I mean... no-one deals with more abuse. Tyrion drinks and knows things. Then he uses those things he knows to perform one of the best and most nerve-wracking Tyrion scenes ever.For the first time in forever, we visit the Iron Islands, and a book moment we've been waiting for for a long time finally comes. I have a feeling that after the way they've screwed up Dorne, they are making sure to take their time and get the Greyjoy plot just right. Well, so far they've succeeded. What a fantastic way to introduce a new character. And the famous Kingsmoot scene can be seen on the horizon.I imagine that the final scene will melt the internet. It's a moment that many people have been waiting for for 5 years (since the last book came out). There's been so much speculation about this for so long that it doesn't even feel real to me now that it has finally happened. Dan and David really had a fun time stretching it out, as well. They really milked that scene for all it had. As I watched it, thought to myself ""at this point, if nothing happens, the director is basically Hitler"". After the sheer disappointment around that Walking Dead finale, the scene almost managed to convince me that nothing was really going to happen. But then, at long last, we viewers were put out of our misery. What an episode. The semi-ex-positional nature of last episode had some thinking that this season would once again fall victim to the flaws of last season, but this is the episode that proves them wrong. This is, in a nutshell, one of the greatest episodes of Game of Thrones, and a fantastic way to get the season rolling."
243," Just beautiful episode
",10,True,"This was a truly beautiful episode. The arc of the story doesn't really progress, but we are told who will be this season's or the next few episodes villains. The story continues with the dragons, the Lannisters. Stark's and the Ironclads.First of all, the writing here is brilliant, with the story heading in a great direction.

244," Rise
",10,True,"Tonight's episode saw the fall of a few Kings and the return of everyone's favorite Lord Commander. I'm surprised it was this soon but wow what an episode. I don't think anyone at this point is doubting the fact that season 6 very well could be the best season to date. Two very good episodes to begin the season and it can only get better.Beginning with Bran, because it has been a minute. I think like many other fans, Bran has never been my favorite character. Similar to Arya, his story has always felt so far away from everything else that has been happening on the show, but with the Three-Eyed Raven, Bran very well may be the key to connecting everything. I love that we are getting flashbacks through him, including next week's Tower of Joy sequence.Cersei can't catch a break, which one of the reasons why if I were anyone in Kings Landing, I'd stay the hell away from her or her bodyguard, The Mountain. This week she wasn't even able to attend her daughter's funeral. I hate her guts for countless reasons but I couldn't help but feel bad for her. Fortunately, Tommen seems to be coming around and ended up visiting her with Jaime's advice. Jaime had a great scene with the High Sparrow who is seemingly threatening him the same way he did to Cersei last year. As far as Jaime has come, I don't know if his future is too bright.Speaking of feeling bad for someone, Theon was a part of what may have been my favorite scene of the episode. That would make it back to back weeks for Sansa as I really loved her embracing Theon. Another character who has gone through so much throughout this show, good and bad. For Sansa to embrace him, that was a big moment. So much so that I actually felt for Theon in that situation and I do believe that he ""doesn't want to be forgiven"" for all that he's done.Theon may be in for a surprise as his father died at the hands of Euron Greyjoy. Having not read the books, I'm not sure how Euron factors into the bigger picture, but I don't see good things happening to Theon when he returns. But Balon Greyjoy wasn't the only major death of the night.Roose Bolton finally paid the dues for his betrayal of the Starks. I kind of wish it was a little more brutal and painful, but Ramsay does his best. Then just when we thought Ramsay had done the absolute worst thing by raping Sansa, he goes and kills his step- mother and newborn baby brother. Yikes. If only someone didn't raise from the dead to keep the attention off of him.With no Daenerys in the episode, Tyrion filled the void by essentially unleashing the dragons from the cave. It wasn't entirely clear where they went, but I don't expect them to be in that cave for long. Arya also had a brief scene this week as she got beat up a little more by Waif before pleading to Jaqen that she is in fact ""no one"". Both great scenes, and both seem to set up the future very well.Lastly, of course is Castle Black. Talk about a surprise. I did not expect Jon Snow to be resurrected this early in the season but I couldn't be more happy. With Sansa heading to the Wall and Snow rising, Castle Black is the place to be. I loved seeing the Wildlings jump in and defend Snow from Thorne and the others. It was also great seeing Davos come to Melisandre for help and believe in what she can do instead of the opposite. I am beyond excited to see the Nights Watch take down Ramsay once and for all. Rise of the Starks here we come.+SNOW+Bran sees the past+Two huge deaths+Tyrion unleashes the dragons+Sansa and Theon embrace10/10"
245," Unreal
",10,True,"I could not fault this episode if I tried to.Dan & Dave clearly aren't waiting around with all of their story lines. They've got a lot to cover and after last season's somewhat underwhelming aftertaste, they're evidently eager to prove they've got what it takes - especially now that we're ahead of the books. Bran is back (and walking!), and he's much more advanced with his powers than when we last left him. We were treated this episode to seeing a younger Ned, Lyanna, Benjen, and Hodor. As one of the Children said, he won't be there forever, so I'm excited to see where Bran heads off to later this season.Tommen, Jaime and Cersei are going to be the fiercest family in Westeros this season. Tommen is even asking for his mother's help. Oh, sweet summer child, if only he knew what he was asking for. Did anyone else flinch when the Mountain (Cersei's colossal knight in shining armour) smashed that commoner's skull against the wall? I thought back to Oberyn's unfortunate encounter with him and immediately shuddered. He's going to be problematic for the Faith; it's only a matter of time.Tyrion and dragons. Holy sh*t. Hilarious and exciting: ""I'm friends with your mother..."" He probably knows more about them than Daenerys! I was so worried that Tyrion would announce he intends to free the dragons from captivity but then we'd have to wait a few episodes until that actually happened. I was delighted to see him descending those steps in this episode and chatting with Viserion and Rhaegal as if he'd known them for years. Ramsay isn't waiting around either. As soon as Walda gave birth to a baby boy, Ramsay knew he had to make a move. I just wasn't expecting him to move so quickly! Now that he's Lord Bolton, Warden of the North, I'm so looking forward to him meeting Jon.The Greyjoys are back, and it's time for a new face. Euron Greyjoy has firmly shoved his older, much more unpleasant brother out of his way, and will likely try to compete with Yara for the throne of the Iron Islands.Arya also - thank goodness - is learning quickly, and has already made progress. The Faceless Man is escorting her back to the House of Black and White, where she'll continue her training. Arya is yet another character which is going to kick ass this season, and she's still got some more names to cross off of that list of hers.Something many feared would occur was that Jon wouldn't return until around halfway through the season and we'd be eagerly awaiting that episode with everything preceding it being sub-par. Well, this goes to show that Dan & Dave aren't waiting about: he's back! I can't wait to see everyone at Castle Black's reactions when they find out he's alive again - especially Ser Alliser and Olly. Melisandre is going to have a field day when she finds out she wasn't wrong after all.This episode has left me with nothing but confidence for the rest of this season; it will live up to and excel beyond the brilliance of season four.We're in for the best season of Game of Thrones yet."
246," Tyrion: The next time I have an idea like that... punch me in the face!
",10,True,"Home is a quality episode, even though there are many different plot lines at play.Jaime talks with Tommen, advising him to speak to Cersei. Jaime then speaks with the High Sparrow. Tyrion unchains the two dragons, at his own risk. Eddison gets the wildlings to assist in dealing with Thorne and the Night's Watch. Ramsay kills all his relations to become the heir. He has been a hindrance up until this point, but he's enjoyable here and beyond. Theon leaves Sansa in Brienne's care and heads home. Melisandre brings Jon Snow back from the dead. Good choice to bring him back, as he's critical to the quality of the show.Tyrion, Jaime, Cersei and Ramsay the standouts."
247," What ""The Red Woman"" should have been
",10,True,"Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.Despite how my review summary sounds, actually still liked a lot but didn't love the Season 6 opener ""The Red Woman"", though some fans did not. Am of the opinion also of finding ""Home"" the superior episode, it was what ""The Red Woman"" should have been and felt more like for me like the season opener. It is one of the most positively received Season 6 episodes and have seen it often considered one of the best latter season episodes, both distinctions for very good reason. Here in ""Home"", characterisation and plot lines are both advanced (loved seeing more of Bran, after being neglected for a while, Ramsay being suitably despicable and am still really appreciating seeing Theon in a completely different light to when he was first introduced. There are plenty of shocks and leaving-one-floored revelations, with like ""The Red Woman"" necessary questions and predictions left on fans' lips being answered and with full impact. A lot happens in ""Home"", but it doesn't feel like there is too much going on or that it feels rushed. It is tautly paced but also takes its time without ever being too much of a slow burner. As one would expect, the cast can't be faulted with Iwan Rheon and Isaac Hampstead Wright here being the standouts. Peter Dinklage as always steals every scene he's in.Visually, ""Home"" looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about ""Home"" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.The writing is thought-provoking with plenty of passion and sensitivity. Summing up, outstanding episode and one of Season 6's best. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
248," Home improves over the first episode with a shocking cliffhanger
",10,True,"Despite the slow plot progression and little to do for the characters, the first episode was a good start to this season. However, this episode surprised me and since there's no problem I have, this is an improvement over The Red Woman.The story is a lot more compelling and advances the plot progression from the previous episodes perfectly. The performances are once again compelling with Lena Headey and Dean Charles Chapman sharing an emotional moment together. And that's not all. It finally revealed the fate of Jon Snow and left a shocking cliffhanger to what would really happen in the next episode.That being said, everything else turned out great. The pacing is tighter and never drags, the script is well-written, the directing is solid, Ramin Djawadi's music score shines and suits the emotional scenes and the atmospheric moments really well, and the editing is really good. So, overall, another classic episode for the entire show and an improvement over the first episode, which I thought was a good start. :)"
249," Game of Thrones continues to amaze
",9,True,"So we now know the fate of John Snow, and the result should surprise absolutely no one. The only flaw in this hour of television was the complete lack of surprise value - Game of Thrones is massively successful because of its ability to shock by usurping expectations. So when the Everyone Gives Up But Wait There's More! suspense routine and the Awakening Gasp trope combined to dilute what could have been a powerful and emotional moment, I was slightly disappointed with the resolution of five years of waiting.But that was basically the only complaint I could possibly muster with what is otherwise an outstanding episode. In taking the lives of his father, (step) mother, and baby brother, Ramsey has finally ascended the ladder and positioned himself to be the primary antagonist for whatever war happens in the North. Tyrion released the dragons in a surprisingly touching and intense scene in the Mereen dungeon, and once again Peter Dinklage is worth celebrating for his nuance and depth he brings to one of television and literature's great characters. Balon Greyjoy was dethroned in another intense scene on a rickety rope bridge in the middle of a torrential downpour, setting up the coming Kingsmoot - the last vestige of foreknowledge that book readers can still lord over the non-readers. Sansa is now going to Castle Black to reunite with John, though I could see her getting detoured if she gets (late) word of John's death.Cersei's giant crushes a braggard, and the Wildling's more-giant Giant also crushes a Crow, both in swift, brutal fashion. Thorne's interrupted siege is another one of a half-dozen suspenseful conflicts, ending with the Ed's predictable return. Great exchange between him and Thorne: ""No commander in a thousand years has let wildlings through into this Castle..."" ""Then you'll be the first."" Bran Stark finally returns and does a little dreamwalking with tree- bound Max Von Sydow, and along with a brief surprising reveal about Hodor, creates a very circle-of-life undercurrent to the show. And even though we don't have any incredible battle scenes here, this episode may be one of the most important ones in the series. It was tonight that I felt the theme of the show has finally come into its own - Balon, Ned, Tywin, the Dornish Prince whats-his-name, Bolton... all are now gone, leaving their conflicts to a new generation. Circle of Life. Interestingly enough, the men are the ones dying, and the women are rising in power and influence in their wake (Cersei, Yara Greyjoy, Sansa, the Sand Snakes, Daenerys, maybe Arya); one might start to suspect a subtle feminist slant to the story.But that's neither here nor there. To borrow from another cultural juggernaut, ""the last remnants of the old republic have been swept away."" With season 6, episode 2, we finally have the table set for the remaining human conflicts. Ramsey plans to march on Castle Black. Tyrion has released the dragons, setting up Daenerys' inevitable (breathtaking, I'm sure) escape from her new prison. Arya is back in the House of Black and White, possibly recovering from her blindness. John has returned, and will likely be reinstated as Commander of the Night Watch and crux of the War against the White Walkers. Sansa is heading toward Castle Black, where she will help unite the North against Ramsey and turn their attentions toward the real enemy. The Lannisters will surely be fighting a Dornish army soon, Bran is training to be the Eye of the North.A new generation is rising in Westeros, and one of this era's most spectacular visions is beginning to ready itself for its inevitably spectacular conclusion. Tonight it stretched its wings, and I sat back in excitement, ready for it to soar."
250," What is dead may never die...
",10,True,"The premiere episode to Season 6 gave us a taste of the craziness of this season, but oh boy, this episode went all out! This is definitely the best episode since Hardhome, and well, arguably better than most of Season 5. They said the first two episodes were going to be strong, but this episode is absolutely amazing, if not perfect. Compared to how ""slow"" the last season was (which isn't a bad thing), this season is going full-throttle, in terms of fast-pacing.Firstly, the episode starts off with Bran, and it was good to see him again. There's no more crawling around in the snow this season looking for the Three-Eyed Raven as, after being absent from the entirety of Season 5, Bran Stark is walking and back in Winterfell (kind of). Well, he's actually having a vision as part of his training with the Three- Eyed Raven, and it's an interesting flashback that definitely sets up R+L=J. It was really strange seeing a young Ned Stark and well, a happy Stark family, but it was a good way to start the episode, although it is the only appearance of Bran in this episode.Then the action really gets going as the Night's Watch finally bash down the door where Davos and co. are defending Jon's body, but (thank God) they are stopped by the Wildlings and taken to the cells. I really didn't expect them to start with this since I thought it would be a great way to end an episode, but it just shows how fast this season is going, much like Season 4 did. Also, it was f*cking awesome to see Wun Wun just destroy one the traitorous black brothers. It then gets to King's Landing where we spent a strangely short amount of time last episode. It starts off with the Mountain literally smashing someone's head in for joking about Cersei's walk of shame, so I guess Cersei is pulling no punches when it comes to dealing with people that insult/annoy her, which is good to see after her humiliation at the end of last season. We then finally get some answers that were left hanging at the end of last season, revolving around Tommen. I was also quite impressed with his acting in this episode as we have quite a touching scene with him and Cersei, after quite an intense scene with Jaime and the High Sparrow. Speaking of this season going quickly, Ramsay straight-up murders Roose right in front of Harald Karstark and their maester before feeding Lady Walda and her baby to his hounds. This whole sequence was incredibly dark and unexpected, especially this early in the season, but it was built up to and made much more sense than Doran and Trystane's death, last episode. Not saying that the Martells' death was bad, but their deaths really felt like a spur-of-the-moment kind of thing, rather than a pay-off. It was a shame to see Roose's character go out like this as he's such an evil and interesting character, but cunning, unlike Ramsay, who's psychotic and terrifying as ever, in this episode. We then get to Meereen, where Tyrion, probably under the influence of alcohol, unchains the two dragons and, thankfully, does not get burned alive like the trailer suggests. It definitely hints at the Tyrion Targaryen theory as the dragons seem to have a bond with him. This scene was surprisingly intense as I really wasn't sure if Tyrion was going to make it out of it because of the unexpected nature of the scene I mentioned in the above paragraph, but luckily he did and ended the scene with a funny little quip to Varys.We also get a quick little Arya scene, which ends with her going back to the temple to potentially get her eye-sight back and start assassinating people...please? This scene was nice and short and didn't drag on like her scenes did in Season 5, which is good. We also see the death of Balon Greyjoy at the hands of his younger brother. This should've happened back in Season 3 or 4, considering when it happened in the books, but it still works here, even though Balon has been absent since Season 3. I also liked how it cut to this scene after Sansa and Theon's touching farewell, where Theon says he wants to go home, and Sansa reveals her plans to go to Castle Black, where Jon is, but we all know Jon's dead, so that won't turn out great.Oh, wait! Yes, after a year of speculating and scavenging through interviews to find out the fate of Jon Snow, we finally know the answer. This scene was great in that it built up tension during the ritual that Melisandre was doing and when she seemingly failed to bring Jon back, I started to think they were going to drag the whole ""Jon Snow is dead"" thing out for another episode. The characters all lose hope too and start to leave. Then BAM! His eyes open. Credits roll...Bravo, Dan & Dave. You lied to us for a whole goddamn year, and, although I was pretty sure he was going to come back, it made it no less jaw-dropping-ly awesome when it did happen. This episode is definitely one of the greats and while it's not on par with Hardhome or Rains of Castamere, it damn comes close. I can't really fault this episode other than that I wish Roose had gone out in a more respectable or spectacular way than how he did, but this is Game of Thrones after all, and I think this episode is reminding us of how unexpected and shocking this show still is. It's a definite 10/10 from me. The internet is going to freak out over this episode!"
251," Makes more and more sense as a TV show, less and less for people with brains
",6,False,"I admit I have grown extremely biased against Benioff and Weiss and their butchering of most story lines. But though I try to write a fair review, they keep feeding me reasons to shake my head in disbelief.This episode was not bad - I could have given it a 7, but I think it's already getting unjustifiably good ratings and I won't help. Let's see: there are some good parts in it. The Greyjoys for one. We get Balon's death and the Kingsmoot. Of course one has to wonder why it took them so many years to include it. But still. Bran's part was good too. The inclusion of young Hodor was nice, though I didn't much care for the fact he could once talk. Also, the three-eyed raven is a huge and unnecessary letdown in terms of appearance at least. Make no mistake. The faults are with the story exclusively and not how it is told. It is still a damn well made show. But without the golden egg goose. Jaime keeps taking steps back in character development. Davos hasn't even asked Melissandre about Stannis but suddenly and for no reason decides he is a huge fan of Jon Snow and asks her to resurrect him. Just like that. Which everyone knew would happen but we are still tormented with a ""oh, it didn't work :( *everyone leaves the room* OH LOOK, IT WORKED AFTER ALL"" scene that belongs in the trashcan of clichés.And of course, we have Ramsay killing his father. The scenes are well played, the subsequent slaughter of the innocents is a powerful addition, but the whole thing, once again, makes no sense at all. Not in Westeros. Not anywhere but the realm of typical TV shows, and GoT used to not be one of those. Why would the Karstarks, or any house of the North, ever consider, for a split second, to aid Ramsay in killing his father. Their collective goals would remain the same, except instead of dealing with the cold, ruthless, but ultimately reliable Roose Bolton, you'd have an unpredictable psychopath presiding over you. The fact is, you wouldn't do that. Not in a song of ice and fire, where decisions make sense. And when they don't, they get punished. But not here. Not anymore. Not for Benioff and Weiss who don't really understand what they are doing and are just, in sad, sad fashion, keeping the most popular / most hated / prettiest characters at any cost of logic and story, all the while getting rid of anyone who might confuse the naive audience they think they are addressing."
252," Superbly Done
",10,True,"I can't offer much to what has preceded me, except to say that there are so many stories heading toward resolution, that waiting will be intense. We get back to Tommon and Cersei. Those sparrows are flexing their muscle. For those with a religious agenda, they are certainly a violent lot. Of all the characters, these guys are the ones I would love to see incinerated. Of course, that means that we need to develop an affinity for one of the most evil characters in all of literature. She is lying in the weeds like a snake with her insipid son. We also get back to Arya and her quest. And what of John Snow? How will he manifest himself in the next episode. And what about those dragons? And Brann and his role. Theon gains humanity again which is all he could hope for. And then the quest for Sansa. Love this show."
253," What is dead may never die
",10,True,"""Mothers mercy"" S5E10 - episode with half dozen of cliffhangers eventually lead to winning an Emmy for D&D but sixth seasons first episode The Red woman was wasted in giving status of all characters left hanging on season 5 finale.However game of thrones has returned with a bang in second episode ""Home"" In this episode storyline has moved way more aggressively and faster than I had imagined. Bran giving flashback of young Ned stark with help of three eyed raven was a great way to start the episode, forcing viewers to have a sit on the edge. The story kept moving with murdering two kings - Roose Bolton and Baelon Greyjoy. I must say - i had thought of roose dying this season but not so early. GOT gave a sweet surprise with payback of killing roose with hands of his own raised psychopath bastard son Ramsay. However death of walda and infant again made me desperate to see Ramsey's head on spike.Tyrion unchaining the dragons' scene was something I found inconsistent with storyline. But since story has moved beyond books and have taken diversion, I have decided to treat books and show separately.The last scene was the most failed secret kept by HBO. It was known that Jon snow is going to come back this season.I am looking forward to see if bastard of Winterfell makes use of his second life and can become more cunning. Overall this episode was a great comeback by GOT after failed premiere. +ve's - Bran's flashback Roose Bolton death Baleon Greyjoy death Sansa Theron conversation Jon snow's return-ve's Tyrion scene with dragons Arya's answer to the man were too predictableMy ratings 10/10"
254," So far disappointed
",5,False,"It seems to me only the fans of the books are getting the kick out of the series, or I'm the only one(okay I'm not) who thinks the writing is S**T. Episode 1 Bryene (or what's her name the albino knight) arrives out of nowhere - unexplained - no one bats an eye, let us assume as usual, but in my opinion the lame ""deus ex machina"" is still lame. Same goes for episode 2 where the wildlings storm the castle gate and save the ""traitors"", literally in the last second.But the most disappointing and anti-climatic bit was in the end of the episode, I was expecting some sophisticated blood magic, not some lame mutterings... and of course focusing camera on the wolf gave away everything, even the makeup was different when Jon opened the eyes in the end. He was like ""finally I can get s**t done"".Okay I will admit Gordon Ramsay slaughtering his father caught me off guard. It was nasty.So all in all GoT is like a lottery, series are filled with these little moments of suspense, where there is a feeling that something will go totally wrong. So the next time two guys staring at each other, make your bets.To summarise, horrible writing."
255," An exciting episode that greatly picks up after the lackluster premiere
",9,True,"Most shows don't tend to put their best episodes in the second of their seasons, but Game of Thrones has done so before with Joffrey's wedding in Season 4 and it did it again with ""Home"". What made ""Home"" especially effective, though, was how much of a contrast it was to last week's lackluster premiere, that did little than give us a glimpse into what our characters were doing before ending abruptly. So many interesting plot developments happened this episode that it was almost overwhelming. First, we got to see what Bran was up to, and though I generally find his storyline to be my least favorite (other than the Dorne stuff of course), it was nice to see him after his one season absence and even nicer to see flashbacks of older characters.On to the most important developments. After seasons of waiting, book readers finally got to see that waiting paid off with Balon's death and the roots of the Kingsmoot to be set up at Pyke.Then, probably the most unexpected event occurred, with Ramsay murdering his father Roose in cold blood. While I think many people were expecting Ramsay to go after Fat Walda and Roose's new son, I among other fans was not expecting him to murder his father. As a Roose fan, this was hard, but I'm excited to see how Ramsay acts as the new leader of the Bolton family (and maybe the Warden of the North?). To make the action even more cold blooded, Ramsay had both Fat Walda and her new born baby fed to the dogs. I don't know if he's as hate-able as Joffrey was, but Ramsay sure pushed the limit in this episode.The moment we were all waiting for came at the very end, and Jon Snow was finally resurrected. Though I'm a bit disappointed that he didn't come back as a white walker (maybe there's still hope), I'm glad he's back and can't wait to see how he handles the mutineers.The fact that there is this much to talk about on the second episode is a great sign and I can't wait to see how the rest of the season pans out!"
256," Everything we were waiting for !!!
",10,True,"This was definitely one of the best episodes so far! While the season's premiere lacked some action episode 2 makes up for everything. So many things happened here.. Ramsay Bolton continues to be probably the worst and most evil hero of the series by murdering his own father (though no one can blame him cause he's Roose Bolton), his ""less than a day"" year old brother and his mother and now becomes Lord Ramsay.. Meanwhile Tyrion decides to release Daenerys' dragons, which was probably not his best idea.. Then there is the scene everyone was waiting for.. YES after countless theories we finally find out what happens with Jon Snow and it's pretty much what everyone expected...Melisandre brings him back to life in what had to be one of the most intense scene of the show. So after episode 2 it's clear that season 6 is going to be one of the strongest so far.. Can't wait to see what Jon's next move is!!"

In Castle Black, Davos and his men is threatened by the Night's Watchmen but the Wildlings breaks in the Castle and the situation switches. Sersei is protected by the Mountain and Tommen does not allow her to go to Myrcella's funeral. However Jaime has a conversation with him and convinces Tommen to meet his mother. Then Jaime challenges the High Sparrow and finds how powerful he is. Tyrion decides to release two dragons that are not nourishing. Arya is being beaten again and is still blind.

Davos makes an impossible request to Melisandre, but the witch is powerful. ""Home"" is a good episode of ""Game of Thrones"", with surprises in Castle Black. Jaime discovers how powerful the High Sparrow is. Ramsey's segment is the most violent and shows how despicable this character is. Arya's segment is boring and it finally seems that her situation will change with the presence of The Faceless Man. The conclusion again is the best moment of the show. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Home"""
258," One of the finest episodes so far...
",10,True,"This season started off brilliantly with the actual appearance of the Red Woman and now the resurrection of Jon Snow. This episode is interesting for many reasons. The most important one is the realization that the Red Woman can use her powers to benefit the people. Secondly, Lord Bolton who has betrayed many Kings has been betrayed and killed by his own Bastard son.Also the story dwells on the powers, the three eyed Raven possesses, by taking Bran to see his own father, Ned Stark training with the Sword.This means that Bran might acquire enough powers to see through the flashbacks of people provided he learns to comeback instead of staying there. Apart from these spoilers, the script was written well. This is one such episode(after Rains of Castermere), where, even without any war or fighting sequence, it is interesting to watch and will be remembered for long."
259," The Prince Who Was Promised
",8,True,"After two strong and packed episodes of Thrones, I found 'Oathbreaker' to be on the slower side, but still had plenty to chew on. Jon Snow is officially back. Cersei is about to do some serious damage to the faith. Arya got her sight back. Dany faced another setback. Ramsay received a gift. And we got a glimpse into the infamous Tower of Joy sequence. I really like that each of the first 3 episodes has started at Castle Black. Kit Harrington has teased that this is going to be the biggest Jon Snow season yet, and looks like he may be right. I was on the edge of my seat waiting for the first lines out of his mouth but I was pleasantly surprised at how long they kept him silent. Seeing Davos sitting in absolute awe of what just happened was equally as pleasing. But nothing was more satisfying than seeing his murderers hanged to death. Alliser and Olly needed to go.With that said, seeing Snow essentially end his watch was surprising. I can't say I actually believe he will leave Castle Black all together, especially with Sansa just around the corner. But having Jon leave just as Sansa arrives is the type of thing Thrones loves to do.We finally got a little bit of hints as to what truly happened at the legendary Tower of Joy sword battle between Arthur Dayne and Ned Stark. Seeing that this was shown through Bran, I knew it wasn't going to be a prolonged sequence but I expected to get to see the conclusion of the Rhaegar-Lyanna situation atop the tower. Unfortunately, it wasn't to be this week, hopefully next episode we get what we are all waiting for.Meanwhile, Dany had another setback as the Khals refuse to see her as the leader she is. Every other storyline seems to be picking up the pace, except for the Mother of Dragons. Assuming Drogon has had enough rest, he should be on his way sooner or later.Back at Kings Landing, Cersei is about to put a beating down on anyone who gets in her way. I loved seeing her and Jaime barge their way through the small council and make their demands. Surprisingly, I'm team Lannister if it means getting rid of the High Sparrow and the rest of the faith. Speaking of which, it was nice seeing Tommen make a move on the High Sparrow, only to see him succumb to his persuasive ways a few minutes later.Varys apparently located the leader of the Sons of the Harpy as Tyrion and the rest of the Meereen crew wait patiently amidst Dany's absence. It's unfortunate that Dinklage hasn't gotten a ton of screen time this season but the few scenes he does get are always wonderful. But I don't suspect we have seen the last of the Harpy, even with Varys' findings.Lastly, Ramsay was presented with a Stark boy, presumably as a bargaining tool for battle later and Arya got her sight back. I really dug the Arya scenes this week as she went through her entire history with Wiaf and Jaqen. I know everyone is expecting her to turn on the two of them and go after the remaining people on her list, but I'm not sold on that just yet. Ramsay on the other hand seems to be brewing up to take Castle Black, though perhaps, it could be the other way around. Maybe Jon Snow takes the battle to him once Sansa informs him of what he's up to? Overall, it wasn't the most shocking or action heavy episode, but it had more set up of what's to come. It was also a nice episode at showcasing the 'Oathbreaker' theme throughout several characters. Although, With 7 episodes to go, I hope the pace picks up a bit.+Snow is a god+Legendary sword battle+Arya gets her sight+Lannisters-Wanted more from the Tower of Joy-Tommen is a wuss 8.0/10"
260," A brilliant episode!
",9,True,"This was the best installment of the season thus far. Sublime character development backed up by top-notch performances, with elegantly paced directional progression of the story-line, along with a couple of intriguing plot points and adequate humor. Altogether a terrific hour of television, excellently built up for the colossal chaos and extravagant blood splatter we most certainly will be pummeled by. Or who knows, maybe there will be light. As long as the writers don't suddenly tread any ludicrous paths due to the absence of any source material, they are set to strike gold. And now the customary agonizing wait for the next episode begins."
261," Frustrating
",7,False,"A good episode by any standard. Yet clearly falls short of the soaring bar GOT has raised until now. The absurd, overly-choreographed fight scene between a younger Eddard Stark and foes, complete with cliched banter, reeks of pure cheese. And the High Sparrow story arc is still as bewildering as ever: how exactly this faith group managed to rob the crown of its power so completely and for so many episodes simply doesn't make sense. Why do Cersei and the small council sit idly by while the sparrows run rough shod over the established order? Why is no one counseling Tommen to eliminate them? I hope that GOT resolve these frustrating inconsistencies soon."
262," Risen from the dead
",9,True,"This episode opens where the last ended; with Jon Snow waking from the dead. He is understandably confused while Melisandre is keen to know what he remembers of the time between dying and returning to life. Later those who killed him are punished and he decides his future is not in the Watch. Meanwhile the Three-Eyed Raven is showing Bran more of his family's past; including things that contradict what he thought he knew about his father. Across the Narrow Sea Daenerys is taken to be with the other Khal's widows; Arya progresses in her training and in Meereen Varys learns who is behind the Sons of the Harpy. Back in King's Landing Tommen converses with High Sparrow and in Winterfell Rickon Stark, along with Osha, is given to Ramsay Bolton. We also see Sam and Gilly for the first time this season as they sail south through rough seas.This was another impressive episode. I was pleased that it immediately dealt with Jon's return to life and asked whether there was divine reason, as Melisandre believes, or whether it has no greater meaning. It was interesting to see a flashback to Ned Stark's early life and learn that he hadn't exactly been honest about some of his exploits; I hope we learn more later, especially about what happened to his sister. After all the talk about Lord Varys's 'little birds' it was interesting to learn just who they were and to see that they are now working for Qyburn. It was also nice to see Arya's training progress a bit; it was getting a bit depressing seeing this strong-willed character getting beaten down every episode even if it was necessary to make her give up her past. The scenes with Daenerys at Vaes Dothrak were interesting enough, even though not much happened they hinted at things to come. While this isn't the most action packed episode it does have its moments; most notably an impressive sword fight in Bran's vision but also during Arya's training, even if in the latter case we can guess that nobody is going to die. Finally it was great to see Rickon Stark again even if he is in a perilous position to be honest I'd forgotten about him. Overall this was another solid episode."
263," This season ... So far spectacular
",10,True,"The first two episodes of this season caught me off guard, they were beautiful written, acted and upped their game of production, making this season the most visual stunning yet.This episode continues this tradition and gives us yet again another stunning episode. The first shot we get is of David' face and the sheer shock on his face made me smile. The way the actors reacted to Jon's resurrection was as real as it was going to get.Without any spoilers, this episode is very slow paced when compared to the others. But there are many scenes, including the Tower of Joy scene, which is fantastic. We finally get to see a decent sword fight since season 4. However there are some plot twists that are much different than the book, which might annoy some book readers, and the gift presented to Ramsey, I wasn't too fond of. Unless it is going to hit Ramsey back in the head, I hope they don't kill the gift off, as we have not seen him in 3 years. It would be a waste.Other than that, this episode was brilliant, I can't wait to see the free Jon Snow kick some ass."
264," Another solid episode
",8,True,"Last week's episode was always going to be a tough one to beat in terms of quality and storyline progression, but S6E03 did a damn good job at trying. This episode gave satisfaction to the audience in more ways than one, and some scenes will go down in GOT history.My personal favourite moments from the episode came from Bran and the Three-Eyed Raven. The Tower of Joy flashbacks gave us enough content to satisfy our expectations, whilst still leaving it with a strong element of mystery. It was fantastic to see Eddard Stark again, even if it wasn't Sean Bean playing him this time; we forget how attached we all were to Ned in season one, and it is rewarding and special to see the character again after so many years. Bran's story is really becoming interesting, he was never that interesting in my own opinion, I didn't feel any major attachment to him compared to the likes of Arya and Robb. Season Six has already had a fair few comedic moments, and this episode was no exception. The scenes in Meereen involving Tyrion and Grey Worm were hilarious. Daenerys' storyline is a bit slower compared to the others but it was good to see her again after her absence last week. I hope we see Drogon soon! It was also fantastic to see Sam and Gilly again, as well as Osha and Rickon.The episodes closing act saw the deaths we have all been craving for so long; Olly and Alliser Thorne finally got the punishment they got for stabbing Jon. I must say that Owen Teale (Thorne) is a fantastic performer, and it will actually be sad not to have him feature on the show anymore, but then again, f**k Ser Alliser, and double f**k Olly, they deserved exactly what they got.Overall 'Oathbreaker' is not disappointing in the slightest, and it really delivered with its fan service; 8/10. Performance of the week: Max von Sydow (Three-Eyed Raven)"
265," Breaking the oath
",9,True,"Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.It is always a Herculean task following on from such greatness seen previously. ""Oathbreaker"" had a tough task succeeding, and being just as good as, the previous episode ""Home"" considering how superb that episode was (one of the best Season 6 and latter season episodes). A tough task that it almost succeeds completely in, it's not quite perfect and it's not as special but it has a vast majority of what makes 'Game of Thrones' so great and signs that one shouldn't give up on the show. Tommen needs to develop a stronger personality and have more meat to his material before being considered as a love to hate character for me. Actually though there is hardly anything wrong with ""Oathbreaker"". It doesn't matter that it is not as action-packed as the previous two episodes (compared to ""The Red Woman"" actually that's a good thing), while not quite being a slow or quiet episode either. It also doesn't matter that it doesn't have as many reveals, shocks or cliff-hangers as ""Home"".What ""Oathbreaker"" does brilliantly in is putting things in place for what is to follow, without feeling like filler, forwarding story momentum and advancing character development and interplay. Daenerys and Arya are particularly well done in this regard and it was wonderful to see some development to Khaleesi. The highlight of the episode though is the Tower of Joy, totally exhilarating. Have nothing to fault the cast, who give uniformly never less than great performances. Iwan Rheon plays a true slimeball to perfection, now Ramsay is my definition of a love to hate character.Visually, ""Oathbreaker"" looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about ""Oathbreaker"" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.The writing is thought-provoking and very rich in layers with plenty of passion and sensitivity. Summing up, terrific. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
266," Good episode
",9,True,"Albeit not as surprising as the previous episodes, this episode was pretty good. I'm not going to summarize the whole episode with lengthy paragraphs, so I'll try to keep it short; in Meereen, Varys gets quite some screen time, as he threatens the prostitute who slit the throat of an Unsullied, while providing her safe passage, eventually knowing who funds the Sons Of The Harpy. Meanwhile, Tyrion in a hilarious scene, felt like a socially awkward man, as Missandei and Grey Worm kept on a poker face. He tried to play a drinking game with them(good throwback to the Lannister tent where Tyrion, Shae and Bronn had a drinking game), only to find out that they didn't drink. Moving on to Bran's visions, we finally got to see Young Ned, Howland Reed etc fight Arthur Dayne, and Oswell Went, the two kings-guard of Prince Rhaegar, as Ned asks why they weren't with Rhaegar. A sword-fight ensues, and everyone is killed, except Ned and Arthur. Arthur, known to possess the legendary sword, Sword Of The Morning in the books, possesses not one, but two swords in the show, which is a weird change. Bran was told that Ned killed Arthur, only to find out in the vision that it was a lie, as Ned is almost killed by Arthur, only to be pierced in the neck by Howland Reed, as Ned delivers the killing blow. The casting for young Ned is spot on, and we see him in a different light here; an angry young man, as he hears screams of Lyanna from the Tower. The scene ends there, as Bloodraven tells Bran he can't spend too much time looking at visions.In Kings Landing, we finally see Varys' little birds; they're little, impoverished children, whom Qyburn feeds sweets in return for whispers, as Cersei asserts that she wants the little birds everywhere. Tommen meets with the High Sparrow, obviously angry that his mother isn't being allowed to see Myrcella's body, as well as angry at her treatment, as the High Sparrow says that she has to stand trial in the front of the Seven. Tommen is easily moved and fooled by the High Sparrow's speech. As we expected of him; he's still an innocent child.In Bravos, Arya finally gets back her eyes, after a lot of questions asked by the Waif, as we get a throwback to the past, about the Hound, and Arya's list, as well as Arya's family, as the show gives a hint that Rickon's still alive.In Winterfell, Smalljon Umber brings two hostages for Ramsay, though he refuses to bend his knee to him, while throwing some F-Bombs. Classic Umber. The hostages turn to be none other than Rickon and Osha, as Smalljon presents Ramsay with the severed head of Shaggydog, Rickon's dire-wolf. Rickon's actor, Art Parkinson has grown! Quite a change. This will be the fuel for Battle of Bastards that's to come.In Castle Black, Jon awakens and can barely stand, shocked at what's happened. The only thing he remembers is being stabbed by his own men. Mel asks him what he saw after he died, and he says nothing, to her dismay. He dons the Lord Commander's garb, as Tormund makes a dirty joke, hugging him, the next being Edd, as we see that Jon's not changed much, except his hair. However, all the mutineers are prepared for hanging, with Jon walking toward them, as he asks them for his last words. Bowen says Jon shouldn't be alive, stating it's not right. Jon replies ""Neither was killing me"". He moves onto the next man. Yarwyck pleads Jon to tell his family that he died fighting the Wildlings. Alliser then says he had a choice, to betray his Commander or the Night's Watch. He then says that Jon bringing the Wildlings was a dangerous problem and had to be stopped. Jon moves onto the silent Olly, with the boy glaring furiously at Jon with immense hatred. Jon reluctantly cuts down the rope, killing all four traitors.Jon looks at Olly's lifeless body, feeling remorse. Afterwards, Jon takes off his cloak and hands it to the confused Edd. Jon then says Edd can do whatever he wants with the cloak, unofficially labeling Edd as the 999th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. Jon then leaves the courtyard, saying ""And my watch has ended."" with the rest of the wild-lings and Night's watch men looking on. Wow! Talk about character development. As R R Martin said, resurrection would change his characters, and we see that Jon has come back darker and more brooding. Death has finally released Jon from the vows, and he truly looked tired of the bullshit that's been happening in the Night's watch; in the first season, he was told great stories about brave Night's watch men, only to find out that they're a group of thieves, robbers, etc. It is pretty evident that Jon is going to don the Stark armor and take back Winterfell from Ramsay, adding that Rickon and Sansa's situation only fuels his quest to kill Ramsay. We're gonna see new shades in Jon's character, and it's pretty brilliant."
267," Things Are Boiling Over
",9,True,"I know that Cersei and Jaime are villains, but I find myself pulling for them right now (with the exception of Margaery Tyrell (Lannister) whom I find really victimized). But those sparrows are so despicable. They represent a contrived religion that calls to mind the Spanish Inquisition. They are smug and dangerous and don't seem to practice much of what they preach. I'm really looking forward to this ineluctable collision. I still don't quite know what Arya's endgame is. I think I lost it in some of the deluge of events. Where is that dragon? Dany is playing a bit of a waiting game. There are so many characters who are soon to be rising from the ashes. John Snow has literally done so. This episode, while lacking bombast, is laying a foundation of incredible explosiveness. Ramsay Bolton continues to lay down his slime trail. One wants so badly to wipe the disgusting grin off his face. He has been ""forced"" into patricide and infanticide, but the powers that be know what he is. What a magnificent villain he is! Anyway, it's going to be great fun watching things unfold."
268," Another great entry into a superb season so far
",9,True,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Oathbreaker"", the 3d episode in season 6 is a very good entry into season 6 so far. In this episode i loved everything for what i love this show overall - one of the kind settings, great acting, superb writing, directing and excellent pacing. Story itself is moving forward, i like the directions it's taking. After a magnificent episode ""Home"", ""Oathbreaker"" didn't disappointed. I loved the outcome with traitors in Castle Black and all the scenes with Jon Snow clicked right.Overall, we are 3 episodes in season 6 - and they all were beyond good. Can't wait for next entries."
269," Awesome
",10,True,Great episode. One of my favourites in this season
270," This is a fun episode to watch.
",9,True,I really enjoyed this episode. mixed with humor & relax scene. and a few surprises.
271," Sigh...
",1,False,"This show has gone off the deep end this season. Let me start by listing a few grievances.What was the point in showing the Tower of Joy flashback if they were going to omit what made it important in the first place? I mean, That scene was absolutely irrelevant in showing if they weren't going to show it all the way through. I would go in depth about what was supposed to go down but only book readers know what I am talking about.Also, character motivations no longer make and sense whatsoever. Everyone who has a general understanding of the show understands that Umbers are fiercely loyal to the Starks. Yet when Rickon arrives to the Umbers, they take little Rickon, kill his wolf, and give him to Ramsey. YEAH, because that totally makes sense within the lore of the show.In addition to this, I read somewhere that Ramsey has become a Mary Sue type villain, and I have to agree with this statement. The thing that made Joffrey such a captivating villain was that he had limits, boundaries and actual motivations. Idiotic actions he committed actually had dire consequences. But nope, that's not the case with Ramsey! He is able to commit stupid decision after stupid decision and not receive any consequences whatsoever. NOPE! He is able to receive a new found ally and Rickon Stark! WOW! That makes sense in a universe where every action has consequences.I also am despising the amount of screen time they are devoting to Tommen. I mean, the best part about Tommen in the novels is that he is young and absolutely irrelevant to everything going on in Kings Landing. It is Cersei who the Kings Landing pplot was also focused on, but instead the show is trying to actually make us care about Tommen when he is absolutely irrelevant to the overall story.Also, Jon Snows resurrection has to be one of the most anti-climatic things in TV history after all of the hype. Usually the thing that made resurrection so interesting in the Game of Thrones universe was the fact that when someone gets resurected, they suffer dire consequences. When Beric would be continually revived by Thoros, he would forget things of his past, until he eventually forgot everything he was. Jon Snow is exactly the same. I mean, one could argue that all he cares about is vengeance seeing how he hanged the peple who killed him, but I don't see it this way. These people had to be murdered for killing their Lord Commander, not because Jon is changed and out for vengeance. Jon Snow is exactly the same with no character regression or anything.The only things they did somewhat right is daenerys storyline and the storyline in Meeren. However, the war that they are setting up in Meeren is something they shoud've already set up a season ago, and despite the fact that they are going this route now doesn't make up for all of the bs that occurred this episode.All in all, I am not excited with the direction this season is going anymore. This will most like be flagged down as not helpful by the Game of Thrones fanatics who praise each episode. Hey but if you read my review, I thank you for your time."
272," Another excellent episode for the sixth season
",10,True,"Oathbreaker does a great job continuing where Home left off with Jon Snow being brought back to life and vowing to bring an end to the murderers who killed him at the end of the fifth season. I saw the preview of this last night and much like the previous episode, it surprised me. There aren't any problems I do have with it.The plot progression's very solid this time around and it continues to advance the story lines perfectly. Jon Snow, Arya, and Bran had so much to do. The same goes to Daenerys and Tyrion not to mention Ramsay Bolton planning on what to do with Rickon, one of the Stark family members. The script is superb and the performances continue to be compelling. Also, it has a nice set up to what's going to happen in the later episodes. If Jon Snow battles against Ramsay Bolton in the middle of this season, it would be really cool.The directing is smooth and well-focused, the editing is solid, the pacing is really good and never drags. The character relationships are still as interesting as they were in the previous seasons, the sets are still lavish along with the gorgeous scenery and Ramin Djawadi's music score continues to shine. So, overall, Oathbreaker is another excellent episode that lives up to the high standards left by Home. Thumbs up. :)"
273," Game of Thrones - S06E03
",9,True,"I loved how they started with Jon Snow. It was only fitting that we picked up right from where we left off last episode. I really like how well Harington played this scene. We've really only seen a leader Snow and from what I can remember we haven't seen a large range of emotion from Jon Snow as a character. I thought Harington brought a large amount of emotion to his reawakening especially with him dealing with trying to come to terms with what has happened. I really liked how the following scene played out with everyone being so scared of Jon, and Tormund being the one to speak everyone else's minds.Catching up with Sam is always great. It's the first time this season we got to see him and I think they really gave a great introduction and reminder to what is happening with him and Gilly. I really hope that we get to see Sam back at Castle Black sooner rather than later because I really liked the relationship they have set up between Sam and Jon. There's a part of me however that is really interested to see where they are going to go with Gilly and Sam, I feel like we could see a big typical Game of Thrones twist involving them in some way.Again everything with the 3 Eyed Raven and Brann was great. I liked how they backed up from last week from showing child Ned and a more matured teen Ned this week. I really like how through Brann was are getting a form of prequel series to what happened before season 1. So far I've really loved these and I can only hope that they really continue this throughout the season. I really love Max von Sydow in these scenes. I think he really plays the power figure well really stands as a wise character.I'll admit, I'm not too sure on the direction they are taking with Daenerys. From the start of the series I was really invested in Daenerys and her drive towards the iron throne. But since the start of season 5, she's been a bit of a let down. While everything with the dragons and her time at Meereen wasn't in anyway boring, I just miss the drive she had earlier in the series. I hope they really recapture this aspect of her and get to see her back as a dominant force in the series.I really loved Varys in this episode. I like how he is no longer playing the side character and is becoming a leader in his own way. As the audience we really saw him pulling the strings and being a dominate character but its great to see him step up and take on a large role and dominate in it.Again, Tyrion was fantastic. Peter Dinklage continue to hit it out of the park. Full credit to the writers though. They have really turned the heat on Tyrion and he has so many memorably lines. He is really the comedic relief of this show and he plays this role fantastically. I loved how he had some wised words and when questioned who said it, he replied that it was him. Even though I've heard that singe joke heaps of times, it's the execution from Dinklage that allows him to nail it.I thought everything at Kings Landing was fantastic. I really like how they are playing with the Zombiefied Mountain. Everything from the reaction of the kids to the old guy, that I will never remember his name, farting himself. For me I really hope that we get to see The Mountain in action again this season. I know we are only a short way through but I'm just hoping that we get to see him play a massive role in the back part of the season.Tommen really got a big part this episode and I really liked it. While he is no Joffery and we don't love to hate him, I love he we are seeing him grow as a king. I thought he had a fantastic conversation with the High Sparrow. High Sparrow has been really great this season and has followed on from his big role at the back end of last season. Bit by bit I'm starting to really like him as a character.Arya's storyline stepped up this episode. I've always loved Ayra's storyline and I thought that it was always going to be interesting to see what happens with her blindness. I really loved the Daredevil style training montage we got this episode. They really represented her drive and determination which is a characteristic that made Arya one of my favourite characters.The reveal at the Bolton Castle was extremely unexpected but I loved it. We unfortunately got a bit of a spoiler from Maisie Williams that Rickon was going to return but I expected that to be towards the end of the season. I'm probably the same as everyone else in thinking that Rickon has grown up a hell of a lot. You really can see with the hair how he looks so much like Rob Stark. Hopefully the story with Rickon is played out well through the last bit of the season. There would be nothing worse than having both him and Osha reappear in the series for them to just be killed off.I thought the final scenes was a great way to end the episode. I wasn't really excepting to be a major death this episode, let alone 4 hangings. I liked how they came full circle this episode and ended back on Jon to get revenge on his death. Of course the big moment was Jon retiring from his Command. It now lays a great foundation to take Jon on a different path that we haven't seen him in a while since his time with the Wildlings.9/10"
274," A Sad Ending
",8,True,"Speaking of this episode, I have to say that there are a lot of things in the episode that we might miss if we don't watch them properly. Moreover some weird nice or can be called magic we can watch this episode. Here are some glimpses of the old days, as well as some old ones. In this episode we can see all the things that we may not try to see. I agree, the episode is a little slower than the previous two episodes. But with that it has to be said that the episode is starting a lot new."
275," Solid Episode
",9,True,"This episode was very good. No shocking reveals or resurrections, just good storytelling. This episode Jon wakes up from a long nap. With Davos and Jon both thinking WTF but not actually saying anything, Jon gets up realizing he was indeed dead. A lot It is said without words actually being spoken. Tower of joy. Much anticipated scene, I thought it was very well done especially Arthur Dayne, I thought he looked amazing with the sword. This was also interesting to see how things actually happened rather than the survivors interpretations of what happened. Unfortunately Max Von Sydow did blue ball us by taking Bran out of this vision before we could go into the tower. Hopefully we revisit this soon. Bran is not happy about getting taken out of the past to live in the present due to his happiness in the past and his dismal present and out looking future . Daenyrs joins other khal widows. We have not seen much of her this season through 3 episodes.. Lord Varys gets some information. Cersei states her intention to fight ser gregor as her champion against the faith. I am with Jaime, I cannot wait to see this trial by combat(CBGH) Pycelle lets loose after seeing ser gregor. The small counsel leaves Jaime and cersei. Tommen gets manipulated yet again. Very good scene with the high sparrow and tommen, tommen easily swayed after hearing something tywin once told him about listening to counsel so he takes this advice. Arya gets her sight back through it appears she is still drawn to her family, when she is praying to the olds gods of her family despite not knowing this while being blind. Rickon and Osha return and shaggy dog. I have watched this scene multiple times and I actually do not believe that was shaggy dog and I do not believe the Umbers are being straight with Ramsey. I don't know if it is just wishful thinking, but the wolf's head was small and Umber was throwing around a lot of insults and refused to swear any allegiance. We shall see. Jon gets justice against his murderers, we get justice with a long glimpse at #f*c*Olly. Jon states to everyone that because he has died, his watch has ended as he drops the mic and walks off stage."

280," Arguably the best non finale episode to date
",10,True,"This episode had me on the edge of my seat from beginning to end. Reveal after reveal was outstanding. Last week was good, but this one blew it away.Where last week saw Jon Snow take his first breath in several days, thanks to Melisandre's witchcraft, we picked up where we left off. Jon remembers everything about being murdered, and because of that, it leads to him handing in his letter of resignation to the Night's Watch. Does this mean Jon could now be in the running to win the most uncomfortable chair in the world? Who knows. But I'd like to think so.Arya's arc has suddenly sprouted leg (and eyes?), and now she's ready to start her real training. I'm pretty excited about Arya getting to become one of the Faceless eh, Men? as it means she can get some much-needed payback and open a can of whoop-ass on everyone that's messed with the Starks. Watch out Walder Frey, Ramsey Total- Loonball Bolton, and Cersei Lannister!It also sounds like The Hound might still be alive. And speaking of Master Bolton; his latest hostage is an absolute doozy! None other than Rickon Stark! I was wondering when he'd show up, but I never expected an appearance like that.Memorable scenes: ""A girl has no name"" Jon cutting the rope to hang his killers. The look of death on Olly's face. King Tommen being outsmarted by the High Sparrow. Arya's Rocky-inspired training montage. The Small Council meeting. Gregor Clegane. Bran watching a young Ned Stark fight Ser Arthur Dayne. Tyrion' trying to play a drinking game. And Jon walking out of Castle Black for the last time.Awesome episode!"
281," Intrigue and mystery...
",9,True,"This episode has the unfortunate position of following up last week's powerhouse episode, so anything this episode does should be quite underwhelming. Well, that isn't the case with this episode as it delivers on everything that makes Thrones so great: witty dialogue, bloody action, shocking turns of events and mysterious story lines.In terms of witty dialogue, there's a well-paced scene between Varys and the Harpy prostitute, preceding an excellent and down-right quotable scene between Tyrion and Missandei and Grey Worm, which is just Tyrion at his best. I really hope this season continues to give us these kinds of scenes with Tyrion as they were sorely lacking last season because of Tyrion's depressed and bleak attitude towards life, and they were also part of what made Season 2 so good. At the start of the episode, we get a surprisingly humorous exchange between Jon and Tormund & Edd, which is right after Jon is found out to be alive. This was really needed and worked really well as it provided some comic relief that kind of grounded the scene. Also, I don't think Jon should be seen as a godly character since a crucial part of his character is that he is the shameful bastard of Ned Stark, which really humanises his character.Speaking of Ned Stark, we get the awesome and bloody action that Game of Thrones is known for as we get an almost Star Wars-like sword fight between Ned & his men and a dual-wielding Arthur Dayne who takes on all of them like a boss. I was just in awe of how amazing this sequence was that I didn't mind (too much) that the flashback ended before Ned went into the tower. But don't get me wrong, that was INCREDIBLY frustrating! Damn Three-Eyed Raven is such a cock-block. Although I'm pretty certain I and nearly everyone else knows what he's going to find in that tower, I still can't wait. Looks like we'll have to wait until episode 5 to find out the truth, which is a good thing because I don't think the show was ready yet in this episode to show the R+L=J reveal to casual viewers. I think there's just a bit of groundwork to cover to properly set that up. I do wonder how non-book readers or people that just watch it casually and don't do any external research on the show will think of this flashback. Either way, for me, this scene was great and still left on a mysterious and intriguing note. That scream Ned heard from the tower gave me chills! And it definitely sounded like a woman giving birth... There is other good stuff such as Jaime and Cersei teaming up and Arya's training finally being concluded. I mean, did I just hear Pycelle fart when he saw the Mountain? I also like the Ramsay & Rickon scene, though I knew it was coming, I didn't expect them to kill off Shaggy Dog. The ending scene is definitely setting up some awesome future episodes with Jon Snow leaving the Night's Watch because he did technically die. Overrall, this episode is half payoff/conclusion to some story lines (e.g. the identity of the Harpy's masters, the Night's Watch traitors, Arya's training, Jon's time at the Watch) and half-setup for future episodes, which gets me excited for what's to come. However, this episode also delivers on many of the aspects that make Thrones great. The only thing that stops this episode from being a 10/10 is that there are no mind-blowing or overly shocking moments, but this episode definitely gets a 9/10 from me."
282," Come and See
",10,True,"Season 6 is shaping up to be one of the best seasons of Game of Thrones yet, and we're only a mere 4 episodes in. 'Book of the Stranger' contained one of the most satisfying scenes of the entire series, saw the rebirth of Daenerys, and plenty of other tidbits for the fans to chew on. For as miserable of a show this has been, it seems that good things are finally happening for the characters we have come to love for so many years, and I couldn't be more pleased with what I'm seeing.Beginning in Castle Black, as we have for all 4 of the episodes so far, Sansa finally reached The Wall. I was relieved her and Jon didn't coincidentally 'not' cross paths, as Jon wanted to leave. Their reunion was probably my favorite moment of the entire season and one of the most heartwarming scenes this show has had to offer (of the few that they've had). We've all been waiting for Sansa to take that big leap forward after all she's been through, and convincing Jon to go to Winterfell and take on the Bolton's was a much needed step. Speaking of which, it seems the warning letter from Ramsay involving Rickon's whereabouts was just the motivation Snow needed to make his next move. Unfortunately, that's exactly what Ramsay wants, and they are vastly outnumbered. How can Jon possibly get out of this one? Perhaps another shadow baby from Melisandre would help somehow? Not if Brienne has anything to say about it. Realistically, I'm sure Jon will get enough support from the houses of the North to take back Winterfell, I just hope it happens sooner rather than later. It also should be interesting to see just whose side Baelish is on. I'm not completely buying into him saying they will 'help' Sansa just yet.Similarly, the Lannisters are piecing together their next move against the High Sparrow and the faith. Seeing Cersei and Jaime be so assertive is nice when their son consistently does the opposite. Seriously, when is Tommen biting it? It's always nice to see Olenna Tyrell attempt to shut down Cersei, but in order to get Margaery back, they all need to work together. Anything to bring down the High Sparrow and his repetitive speeches would be welcomed. At the same time, I can definitely see all of the Tyrell's calling it quits this year. It sure seems like Loras would be okay with that. Theon made his way back to his homeland just in time for the 'Kingsmoot' from what I understand. I don't entirely think we need a ton of focus on the Iron Islands, I'm excited to see how they handle the newly reformed relationship between Theon and Yara.Lastly, Dany made a huge step forward this week as she has seemingly taken over all of the remaining Dothraki by once again walking through the flames. Dany has always had great ending scenes for this show, but this one meant a little more. With the Doth on her side, she may finally have enough to move onward to Kings Landing. We knew it would eventually happened, but I'm glad it wasn't dragged out till the last episode of the season. It also served as a great mirror to the 10th episode of season 1. Well done Dave and Dan, well done.Overall, 'Book of the Stranger' showcased the greatness that Game of Thrones can be when it balances set up with pay off impeccably. Season 6 just keeps getting better.+Sansa & Jon finally+Lannisters & Tyrells working together?+Dany walks through the flames again+The Letter+Baelish up to no good-Tired of High Sparrow's speeches10/10"
283," Call the banners
",10,True,"***May Contain Spoilers***While this episode served mainly to set the stage for things to come, it was filled with great scenes and some great dialogue. One of my favorite scenes was Little Finger owning Lord Royce. Little Finger completely flips the threat on himself onto Lord Royce as Robbin is easily manipulated by Baelish who will really rule as Lord of the Vale. Curious to see Sansa encounter Baelish again. He did send her off to Ramsay but she needs the Vale so she will need to quickly forgive. Tyrion does some negotiating and acts in Daenery's absence and gets some backlash from his colleagues for his proposal to the Masters of Astapor, Yunkai and Volantis. Jorah and Daario reach Daenerys and attend the dosh khaleen. Daenerys heats things up and wins some support in the process. Can't wait to see the Tyrell's and Lannister's take on the High Sparrow and the faith and then Jon, Sansa, the wildlings, the Vale and any northern houses who will rally behind Jon and Sansa to take on Ramsay. Brienne gloats and talks some s*** to Davos and Melisandre. Cersei, Jaime, the Queen of Thorns and Kevin Lannister discuss working towards a common goal. Theon and Yara reunite in an iron born way, but never the less unite to make Yara the leader of the iron islands. Jon gets ""the pink letter"" as Ramsay personally calls Jon out and claims to have Rickon and will flay all the wildlings and makes a few other threats which influence their response to the letter. This episode really set the stage for the plot line in the north, Mereen and Vaas Dorthrak, King's landing. Can't wait to see the battles in the North. King's landing is about to go war as well as Mereen. The next 6 episodes should be amazing."
284," What an episode!
",10,True,"Season 6 does it again, with another outstanding episode. It is perfectly paced this time around, with each character getting a reasonable amount of screen time without it being rushed over.The scenes with Tyrion and others have to some of his best scenes in a long time. The writing is yet again fantastic. Seeing two characters meet up again after so long, was one of the most tear-jerking scenes in a TV show period. Cersei becoming more of a bad ass this time around, gaining others to her side, and it looks like House Lannister and Tyrell might actually form an alliance. This episode was great throughout, there was not one dull moment, and again with Ramsey being one step ahead of everyone around him, leading to a shocking scene. But all of this leads to one of the best endings in the show so far. Throughout seasons 4-5, people have said that Dany has had little to do, but if they say that again after this episode, well, they are just haters. She shows her true powers, since season 1. It is all played around to feel like season 1 finale, and it doesn't disappoint. This also helps when there is an extraordinary soundtrack playing in the background.Brilliant episode, season 6 is the best season along with season 4. 10/10"
285," The Gift of the Stranger
",9,True,"A superb episode that benefits from having extra time to map out its storytelling, Book of the Stranger is a maelstrom of death, deceit and reunion. Unlike other seasons, Season 6 has gone straight for the kill with its plot developments and they're hitting the mark so far. A quiet premiere, led to a tumultuous second episode, and an intriguing third episode, led to this exciting story for episode four. So much is happening, it's sometimes hard to keep track of each character, but I'll try.Firstly, we have the incredibly touching reunion of Jon and Sansa, so touching in fact, that it didn't need words to explain. Along with Ramsey's threatening letter, which conveniently brings Tormund to Jon's side, the North looks to be in quite a precarious position, and even Melisandre is falling in line with Jon. The only thing is, I feel Edd may perhaps try to steer Jon around to the realistic situation, involving White Walkers. As an aside, it's great to see Littlefinger and the Vale again, with a tantalising development that Baelish has persuaded Lord Rob to fight for Sansa's freedom. In Winterfell, it's a scene that I was dreading to happen, but I knew it would, where Osha is killed by Ramsey, who gives us another reason (adding to a long list here) to despise his existence.Briefly, in Pyke, we have another reunion, but one that's not so touching. It seems Yara, understandably, has lost a lot of her affection for Theon since she attempted to rescue all that time ago, and she's still bitter about it. But she eats her words when she hears that her brother is willing to support her claim in the Kingsmoot. In King's Landing, tensions are most definitely boiling as Margaery sees through the High Sparrow's symbolic words and warns her brother not to succumb to their torture and temptation. Meanwhile, Lady Olenna and Queen Mother Cersei have miraculously agreed on something, if for entirely different reasons. If the Tyrell army comes to King's Landing, who knows what exciting things could happen in the Capitol very soon. Things are moving quickly in Meereen, with Tyrion meeting rather convivially with the masters of three cities in Slaver's Bay, Yunkai, Astapor and Volantis. His diplomacy quickly pays off, but I wonder whether his offer is enough to persuade them to change their ways. I sympathise with Missandei and Grey Worm, however, that his plan is closer to helping the masters stay rich rather than freeing the slaves.But finally, the biggest developments of all, in Vaes Dothrak Jorah and Daario have arrived to rescue their Queen. Despite Jorah's confident plan, it soon backfires to the point where they're forced to commit a terrible sin in the Dothraki city. They do locate Daenerys, however, and she has a plan of her own. The final scene of the episode is a great call-back to the first season as we are reminded of the true reason why Targaryens have a dragon as their sigil. Daenerys succeeds in burning more Khals than you can count and gains the support, albeit surprised support, of the entire Khalasar outside. It's great to see Daario's reaction as well, as he realises how powerful she truly is. The only thing is missing is Drogon. A high-stakes episode with enough politics to balance the action. Season 6 is quickly on its way to becoming my favourite season so far, which sort of makes me feel sorry for George R. R. Martin, to see his work, albeit a transformed version of his work, being continued without him. Let's just hope that his final books match the series or even better, top them, and everyone will be happy."

",9,True,"Holy crap! What an episode, yet again. Season Six has been fantastic thus far and I am so happy with the quality of the storytelling. My favourite season of Game of Thrones has up until this point been the fourth season, but this season is already proving to be even more exciting and brilliant.It was so heartwarming to see Jon and Sansa reunite after so long apart, it almost reduced me to tears! Sophie Turner (Sansa) is really shining at the moment, and her interactions with the likes of Jon and Brienne are truly mesmerising. She is becoming a strong young woman, and is reigniting House Stark, finally! I especially loved the eye contact shared between Tormund and Brienne, I am certainly hoping that something develops between those two.I was very excited by the return of Littlefinger this week, he is one of the most complex and fascinating characters not only on the show but in television. He certainly did not disappoint me in this episode, and I cannot wait to see what is in store for him and house Arryn next. I was a little bit disappointed to see so little of the Greyjoy's this week but next weeks episode looks as though it will spend more time with the folk of the Iron Islands.Some of this weeks best interactions came from Jorah and Daario, and I loved the street brawl scene the two of them shared with the Dothraki. It was Daenerys who stole the show however. Emilia Clarke is such a talented actress, and her speech to Khal Moorland the Bloodriders was haunting. I had chills watching the final scene, Dany is such a figure of power in the show and it was nice to see her demonstrate what she is capable of once again. HBO have handled her character perfectly, and I am desperate to see where her character ends up next, I am so keen to see Drogon soon!Overall, 'Book of the Stranger' is a captivating and elegant episode with many outstanding moments. Game of Thrones is pulling out all the stops this season, and it is only going to get better; 9/10 for S6E04, it is truly brilliant, and will not disappoint anyone.

Littlefinger returns to Runestone and is welcomed by his nephew Robin and convinces him to send his army to protect Sansa at Castle Black. In Meereen, Tyrion negotiates a truce and the end of the support to the Sons of Harpy with the masters of Slaver's Bay. Jorah and Daario arrive at Vaes Dothrak and they meet Daenerys that explains a plan to them. Margaery meets the High Sparrow and he tells how he learned the truth. Tommen tells to Cersei that Margaery will be exposed to the people soon, and Cersei plots a scheme with Olenna to destroy the High Sparrow. Theon returns to the Iron Island and after a cold reception of Yara, he tells that he wants to support her. Ramsey stabs Osha with a knife killing her in Winterfell. Jon Snow receives a letter from Ramsey with insults and threatening him. Daenerys is brought to the khals in a temple and the set in motion her evil plan. ""Book of the Stranger"" is among the best episode of ""Game of Thrones"". Every segment is excellent and important, but the reunion of Sansa and Jon Snow and the final scene of Daenerys and the khals are spectacular. The encounter of Brienne with Davos and Melisandre is tense. Soon the viewers will certainly see the bloody war that is coming. The powerful music score in the end is another great attraction of this great show. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Book of the Stranger"""
288," Engaging and fiery, Book of the Stranger succeeds in every way
",10,True,"After the second and third episodes were an improvement over the first episode (which I thought was really good despite how slow it got) with stronger character depth and solid writing, Book of the Stranger continues the high standards. Sure, we haven't seen more of Arya's story-arc where she got her sight back and decides to have no name, but this episode is where Season 6 might get more and more compelling.The story remains as interesting and has some really effective moments were Sansa and Jon Snow reunite and vow to rescue Rickon Stark after receiving a letter from Ramsay Bolton along with the finale where Daenerys Targaryen taking charge of all the khalasars recalls her story elements of the beginning of the first season and does so perfectly. The writing is at the high standards left by Home and Oathbreaker and the performances are still superb with Kit Harington, Emilia Clarke, and Sophie Turner giving out some of their best acting. The directing is stupendous, the pacing takes it time to bring some depth and it succeeds, the editing is solid, the sets and scenery are still lavish, and Ramin Djawadi continues to bring some beautifully well-done atmosphere and some exemplary emotion to it (OK, I'm not British, but I always wanted to use that word).Overall, Book of the Stranger continues where the last two episodes left off. It's engaging, fiery, and touching. Highly recommended! :)"
289," Game of Thrones - S06E04
",10,True,"I'm going to start by saying this episode was just straight out fantastic. The past week I've watched a few episodes from season 1 and I was actually surprised how contained the show started. We all now know Game of Thrones as this show spread over a whole globe with multiple stories happening at once but we forget that the show started with only a few locations. What I really liked they have started doing this season is starting to limit the story lines. We got this last year when we saw our first team up with Tyrion and Varys joining Daenarys in Meeren. Now we finally reunited two Starks, Sansa and our favourite bastard Jon. I thought that everything at Castle Black with them was fantastic and I really hope that we continue to see them together and start reuniting other members of the Stark family.It would usually be really weird to be 4 episodes into a season and still seeing characters for the first time for the season, but not in Game of Thrones. This episode we got our first appearance of Little Finger and Margery. I really liked the Little Finger scene because it really reminded us of the character he is. In just 1 scene this season, he has managed to manipulate this childish king into giving him his army. That really stood out to me how we often forget about Little Finger and his is mostly a background character but in the end he is playing the long game. I honestly wouldn't be surprised to see him sitting on that uncomfortable throne in he end. The Margery scene wasn't big in anyway but it was a well rounded scene that reintroduced us to the character for the first time his season. I liked how her appearance really tied into what Cersi and Jamie are planning in King's Landing and trying to manipulate the small council into taking down the High Sparrow. On the High Sparrow he was again outstanding. I really loved his scene with Margery and how he spoke his life story to how he became who he was.Something small that I noticed this episode that I thought was really well was the camera work. Through the scene with the High Sparrow and Margery I thought they really controlled the camera well and it enhanced the power of the High Sparrow as he told his story. The other place in the episode I noticed it was during some of Tyrion's scenes. His scenes were again outstanding, his delivery was spot on and I really love how he has taken on the power role. I thought there were certain times where the used the position of Tyrion in the set and the height of the camera to give Tyrion a bigger appearance. We are never going to view him as anything more than a midget but I like how they are using camera angles to give him a more powerful appearance as he gains more power during the series.There was something that really stood out to me this episode that made me really enjoy this episode and it was the ending. I said last week that I felt the Daenarys storyline has really hit a halt lately and I want to see her fighting for power and taking over armies like we saw her so early in the series. This was the episode she did it. Her speech she gave to the Dothraki was really powerful, something we haven't seen her do in such a long time. Daenarys was introduced to us this determined and powerful character and like I said last week, they shied away from that. So it was great to see her back taking control and being the powerful and dominate force we know she can.This episode was fantastic. There is still so much I didn't touch on in the review but there wasn't one thing I didn't like. What I loved the most about it is how apart from the end, there weren't that many major moments and for the most part it was just basic story progression for the series, but that didn't restrict the episode. Some people may consider these filler episodes but in the end, I don't care if it is the episode that everything happens or an episode that is well executed story telling, a good episode is a good episode and that is what we got tonight.10/10 - See more reviews at thenotsonerdynerd.wordpress.com/"
290," Family reunions
",10,True,"As this episode opens Jon Snow is planning to leave Castle Black but before he does there is a surprise arrival; Sansa, along with Brienne of Tarth and Pod, comes through the gates and after a reunion with her brother tells him that he must prepare to lead an army to retake Winterfell from Ramsay Bolton; he initially less than keen but when, later in the episode, he receives a letter from Ramsay stating that he now has Rickon and demands Sansa's return he agrees that he must march south on Winterfell with a Wildling army. Back in King's Landing Queen Margaery talks to High Sparrow before being allowed to see her brother again. Elsewhere in the capital Cersei persuades Olenna Tyrell that her forces should move to King's Landing to free her children and destroy High Sparrow and his acolytes. A third family reunion takes place in Pike; here Theon is reunited with his sister and promises to serve her. Across the Narrow Sea Tyrion makes a deal with the slavers and Jorah and Daario sneak into Vaes Dothrak hoping to free Daenerys; she has a far more radical plan though.This was a top notch episode; it opened brilliantly; I was sure Sansa's travel north would be dragged out for quite a while longer but no. Her speech to her half-brother showed just how much this character has developed over the series; Sophie Turner was really good in the role. It continues well with plenty of hints at battles to come; Jon's to retake Winterfell; another to bring down the High Sparrow and possibly Yara Greyjoy struggle to become the ruler of the Iron Islands. We also get the welcome return of Lord Petyr Baelish for the first time this season; as manipulative and ambiguous as ever. All of this serves as a mere appetiser to the episodes fiery conclusion where Daenerys confronts the assembles Khals and destroys them in her own inimitable style; possibly this season's best moment so far certainly its most spectacular. On a more downbeat note the episode sees the death of a secondary character who has been around since the first season at least she got to die in an impressive scene as she tried, unsuccessfully, to kill Ramsey Bolton. Overall I think this was this season's best episode to date."
291," Season Six could be the best season yet if this flow goes on
",10,True,"SPOILER WARNING! Wow, just wow. This episode is one of the best episodes of the series and NOT boring. Opposite of boring. Every scene in this episode has a purpose. Almost every scene is awesome and thrilling. Daenerys' story is again interesting. The North has still the strongest scenes in this episode. Stark reunion, one character death (not big character) and threat letter(!). Ramsay is horrible and true villain. Also King's Landing story builds up to big epic challenges in episodes to come. I think this is even a bit better episode than awesome ""Home"". If this great flow goes on I think we have the best season of Game of Thrones so far. Even better than season four. Must say again. Wow."
292," A page turner that is a must acquaintence
",10,True,"Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.""Book of the Stranger"" is one of the best episodes of Season 6, which settled much quicker and more consistently than Season 5 generally, and a standout of the latter seasons, an episode that has everything that makes 'Game of Thrones' as great as it is and what it's all about. It is one of the most acclaimed episodes of the season, have also seen fans and critics cite it as one of the best 'Game of Thrones' episodes, and can totally see why on all counts. Never thought that another Season 6 episode could outdo the brilliant ""Home"", ""Book of the Stranger"" may have just managed that.While the whole story is tremendously absorbing with a lot of passion, sensitivity and emotional wallop, every 'Game of Thrones' episode has at least one standout scene even the weaker ones. ""Book of the Stranger"" has three, the Jon and Sansa reunion, Daenerys' conquering and the scene between Brienne, Davos and Melisandre. All three among the season's best scenes. Anything with Tyrion is awesome and also found the letter scene pretty harrowing with it showing how much a monster Ramsay is. The whole episode is packed with reunions, alliances and forward momentum in both story and characterisation, with plenty of surprises and emotion.'Game of Thrones' has always been consistent in the high quality of the acting. Particularly outstanding performances being from Emilia Clarke and Peter Dinklage.Visually, ""Book of the Stranger"" looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about ""Book of the Stranger"" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film. The end scoring is especially powerful. The writing is thought-provoking and very rich in layers with plenty of passion and sensitivity. In conclusion, fantastic episode and a must watch. And this is coming from a genuine viewer who has not given every episode a 10 (have actually given my fair share of 8s and 9s) and has been honest in her opinions. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
293," Napalms and unbreakable Dothraki reed
",4,False,"There are some good scenes in this episode. Really.But you will not read about them here. Because the bad ones are too bad to be overlooked.A poser and a leper (Daario and Jorah) cross a desert on foot, in the same exact time as the Dothraki. OK, not a big deal. They enter Vaes Dothrak (which is now in an arid wasteland somehow), kill two men for no obvious reason other than risking revealing themselves, and then happen to intercept Daenerys, who has a better idea than sneaking out. You see, her judgement by the Khal council is approaching. So she stands before them, and tells them she will rule the Dothraki. They laugh at her, and then she drops a few braziers. On the ground. On the dirt ground. MAGICALLY, these braziers were secret Napalm bombs brought to Vaes Dothrak from Vietnam, so the fires spread (across the dirt) in milliseconds and envelop the entire giant hut in flames. The Khals try to exit, but Daario and Jorah have killed the guards (in the exact middle of a city with the population density of Bombay where weapons are forbidden) and barricaded the door. The door of a hut made of reed or something, which a small battalion of Conan the Barbarians are completely unable to even try and break. They also allow Daenerys to drop all four Napalms without stopping her, even though she takes surprisingly long breaks between each drop. THEN, the Dothraki, THRILLED that this woman has murdered all their leaders inside their holy city, worship her. You know how everyone just LOVED it when Walder Frey did something similar? Yep, pretty much the same thing.In other news, Davos finally remembers to ask Melissandre what happened to Stannis, when Brienne shows up with a smug look to inform the two she killed him. She also reveals she knows it was actually Melissandre who killed Renly. But apparently she doesn't feel obliged by her oath to do anything about that, because, hell, do you need a reason?(PS) Also, all this time nobody in Meereen has noticed Daenerys is missing. It's not like leaving on the back of a dragon in front of a lot of people is something anyone would notice."
294," Game of Thrones hits a season high by focusing on its women
",9,True,"""Book of the Stranger"" has a tight, clear thematic focus from the first sequence, and this helps to bind the wide array of characters and locations together. This episode was about two things: it was about brothers & sisters, and it was about women focusing on getting what they want. After their wonderfully touching reunion (seriously, if you didn't start welling up I'd suggest you aren't even human), Jon and Sansa sit to discuss both the past and the future. This is brother and sister looking at how they've gotten to where they are, before working out where to go next - except their opinions clash. Jon doesn't want to fight anymore, but Sansa is insistent that they must reclaim Winterfell. Jon refuses to even entertain the idea, until a letter comes from Ramsay stating that he has their younger brother. Sansa pulls Jon around to her side, and they begin their plan to invade and reclaim Winterfell. It's a powerful series of sequences for a number of reasons, but the fact that the episode allows the female character to sway the mind of the male with regards to war makes this all the more important.This theme of brothers & sisters all resonated in a variety of other stories tonight. We saw Theon return to Yara, as she tells him to stop crying and focus on their future. He tells him he will help her rule the Iron Islands. We had Margaery being permitted to visit her brother Loras in his cell, where she instructs him to stay strong and reminds him that the future of their house relies on him. We have Cersei and Jaime interrupting the small council meeting to discuss the High Sparrow with Kevan and Olenna, yet while it's Jaime who relays the plan to the others, Cersei remains in the frame behind him, and it's not difficult to work out that this is her plan and not his. These stories all focus on the brother & sister relationship, but allow the woman to take centre stage and focus on getting what she desires. The women of Game of Thrones may not actually accomplish much in this episode, but this wasn't an episode about accomplishment: this was an episode about strategy, and about scheming. We see brothers and sisters strategising and scheming together here, but the sister is the one leading the plan. It's a testament to the show's history that this feels fully natural, and not shoehorned in for the sake of a feminist approach. It feels real.So while Sansa, Yara, Margaery and Cersei focused on beginning their plans, there was one woman who skipped right past the scheming and went straight into putting her plan into action. That woman is, of course, Daenerys Targaryen. After a slow but thoughtful beginning to her season, Dany's narrative has lurched forward with tonight's instalment. She has simultaneously broken free from the Dosh Khaleen, and proved to the entire Dothraki horde that she is a worthy leader. After the episode focused so heavily on female empowerment it was only fitting that it should wrap up with Dany, she is the show's feminist icon after all. As the various Khals taunt and mock Dany after she tells them she would make a better leader to the Dothraki, she sets the temple ablaze to kill them all and emerges from the flames naked and unharmed, as the entire Dothraki army recognise her power and bow to her. It's a powerful and poignant sequence, made even more exciting by the narrative progression it also represents. Emilia Clarke also gives her best performance here in a long time, so calm in the earlier moments yet so controlling and authoritative as the sequence escalates. It's a terrific scene in every last respect, and easily the strongest material of the season thus far.Not every story managed to fit the brother and sister theme tonight as Tyrion, Varys, Grey Worm and Missandei attempt to persuade the masters of Slaver's Bay to cut off their funding of the Sons of the Harpy and return to the slave-free environment Daenerys set up. While her sequences work to prove that Dany can make a great leader, this sequence also show her flaws in a powerful position: another great thing about this episode's portrayal of women, they're allowed to have flaws and make mistakes but still be just as powerful. This sequence was home to some of the most interesting and thought-provoking dialogue the show has ever offered, especially as Tyrion debates with Grey Worm and Missandei - who plays a large role in the debate, continuing the episode's focus on women. They discuss their differences in tactics in a fittingly intellectual manner, and I cannot wait to see where the show takes these characters next. ""Book of the Stranger"" is a stellar episode of Game of Thrones, boasting one of the most well plotted and thematically exciting scripts the show has had in a long time, as well as a plethora of powerhouse performances. The only issue is that the bar has really been set high now, and next week has got one hell of a task to live up to this."
295," The queen is always the queen
",9,True,"The beginning of the episode touched my heart. When I met my loved ones after many conflicts, I felt exactly the same kind of happiness that I felt at that time. Another thing I noticed behind this is how a person can subdue everyone else just by the force of his intellect. But one thing this episode has taught me is that sometimes enemies have to think of friends as well. I also saw how diligent the Queen's Guards could be to save the Queen. Their lives have no value in front of the queen's life. If you do something wrong, it will always be considered wrong, be it the queen of a state or someone else. So what will the king do now? The mother and her honor on the one hand and the wife and her honor on the other. One man changed himself after enduring repeated tortures, but one day he returned home with the courage of another man to help his family. Some people become demons out of greed for power and some people are born as demons. A queen is always a queen. No one has ever been able to bind him, never will. All I can say is that there is an excitement hidden in everything in this episode."
296," An episode you want to see many times
",10,True,"Another amazing episode, despite the fact that it is in the 6th season and the quality seems to be falling. Lots of interesting scenes and a lot of intensity. I will focus on one of Daenerys' top 10. The setting with the Dothraki leaders is one of the best moments that characterize the quality of the show, but also the excellent playing of the beloved Emilia. You are stunned by the style of dealing with Dothraki's leaders, the expression of devaluation and disgust towards them is one of the best I can remember. That's why I will get stuck many times in this episode and in this scene."
297," Livrr ET
",10,True,Good one. Really building up to a spectacular finale
298," Sansa at long last hits her stride!
",9,True,"Though I've cheered for Sansa from the beginning, the performance of Sophie Turner just wasn't what it should have been. As a late-comer to GAME OF THRONES I had first seen her in BARELY LETHAL, so I knew she was capable of living up to expectations. Less physical performance in this episode, but with acting that makes her the standout character... Well, till the end, Daenerys of course adds fire in more ways than one...So, Sansa made it an eight, and Daenerys made it a nine."
299," Mind Blowing!
",10,True,Seriously.. it's one of the best episode!! Especially the last minutes gave me goosebumps and attracted me to what people thought of this episode and i was amazed to find that some people were kind of bored! Seriously!? I can't believe it..
300," Good Episode. Fast-phase story-telling.
",9,True,"Fast Story-Telling, Good writting. Lots of great scenes. so much happen in this episode. and building up to the Wars to come. This episode show us what is gonna happen in this season."
301," Dani takes over another army without breaking a sweat!
",1,False,"I'm getting rather tired of this. There comes a point when a character gets so unstoppable and powerful that it becomes a boring slug, and that's exactly where Dani's story has gone. I'm getting quite tired of Dani seemingly being unstoppable, unflappable and un-killable. At this point I'll even put money on the fact that when the show does end (Please be soon, because at this point I just want my pain to end) she will be the victor, and how might this come about you ask? She'll simply say a few lines in a monologue and do something completely nonsensical and kill what ever other characters are still in the running in one fell swoop the same way she always has. Something or someone needs to make Dani take a step back and realize she's not all powerful, it's becoming boring."
302," Only thing good about this episode? It's Daniel Sackheim's last.
",2,False,"Daniel Sackheim gotta be the biggest boner killer in the history of TV shows. I didn't think it was possible to make GoT un-watchable but this talented director managed to do it. The way both episodes are filmed doesn't even feel like Game of Thrones but more like some cheap sitcom. Two episodes with great story, so many things happen and yet I'm bored to death and astounded by how many bad scenes and wasted opportunities for good ones, I (and we all) had to witness. Tyrion doesn't feel like Tyrion, Ramsey is suddenly the main character, Cersei with her sidekick just seem to walk from Tommens chamber to small council meeting room and high sparrow stays in one room and talks to people. Did this genius director had 4 rooms on the set to use? Camera work is awful, dialogues vague the quality drop from 1st and 2nd episodes is enormous. Happy to see that Jack Bender worked on next ones, honestly these 2 episodes will be the only ones ill watch once."
303," Boring and sluggish!
",4,False,"Dani's plot line is getting lunatic every passing day. What the heck was that? Do the show writers want us to believe that all by herself she incinerated those ferocious and savage Khalsars who are far more experienced in fighting the actual wars! Every time she dodging fire looks absolutely absurd. She has a Targaryen blood, and so did Viserys, and we saw what happened to him? He was one of the most interesting characters. Jon Snow is another boring and overrated character. I hope he along with his dumb sister gets flayed by Ramsay. Even in Kings Landing things are moving at snail's pace. There are people having decades of experience in politics and war who can't even concoct a full proof plan to overthrow sparrows. Sick of watching that Tommen crying like a baby in every episode.Theon's, Ramsays's, Arya's and Bran's story lines are the only few silver linings in a dark cloud. Another trump card is EURON GREYJOY. I hope he restores the badassary of iron island who were made look like cowards under Balon. Very slow plot overall!"
304," Come and see. Ramsay Bolton, Lord of Winterfell and warden of the North.
",5,False,"Book of the Stranger is an uneventful episode, with a lot of talking and plotting of what will happen without anything happening.Sansa arrives at Castle Black with Brienne and Podrick and embraces Jon. They receive news from Ramsay that he's in possession of Rickon and decide to reclaim Winterfell. The High Sparrow tells his boring story to Tommen, who informs Cersei that Margaery will soon have to do the walk of shame like she did, Cersei and Olena then plot to destroy the High Sparrow. Jorah and Daario track down Daenerys and she takes out the Khals with immolation and regains her followers. The Khals were too unopposing here, for such feared warriors. The episode unnecessarily drags, but it doesn't seem to bother anyone else.Jon, Daenerys, Sansa and Ramsay the standouts."
305," I'm in tears
",10,True,"This episode - where to start. Throughout Game of Thrones there have been a lot of moments that has made you laugh, smile, gasp and cry, but none has done so as much as this one.This is Game of Thrones, and it is truly heartbreaking. But before I talk about the final moments of this episode, I'll review the rest.This episode like the others is beautifully directed and acted, with nearly every scene playing out spectacularly. The scene with Dan and Jorah was great to see, and finally Jorah might get the peace he has been fighting for. We also get our first look at the new Red Woman, and it looks like her presence is going to mirror that of our already known Red Woman.Other than the scenes at Castle Black and at Meerern, and with Arya furthering her training (with a brilliant theatre scene), this episode shines at the end.Wow. The final moments of this episode broke me in two, not even the Red Wedding or Hardhome made me gasp and shake with intensity. It plays out all happy then suddenly does what Game of Thrones does, and pull it from under you. We lose two beloved characters, while you could argue that one is not really a character, but has been with us since season 1 episode 1 as a small cute furry bundle of joy. Seeing what the White Walkers can do has given us something else to fear from them. I am eager to see what comes next for our characters, whats left of them.I could go on to say that this is one of the greatest TV episodes of all times. If you don't like it, you're not a Game of Thrones fan.10/10"
306," Amazing Breathtaking Storytelling.
",10,True,"How should I start???? Wow This episode was a mixture of emotions and mysteries i never thought that they would top ""Hard home"" but they actually did with topnotch storytelling and keeping viewers on the edge of their seats. This is the best episode of the season and definitely one of the great ones. Finally game of thrones is getting the pace we all wanted and in this one oh boy You get that quite a lot . This season started off quite slow there were complains of game of thrones losing its charm and all that. I guess they are saving the best for last. you'll see plenty of new characters and start to understand them quickly that's why this show is so good it makes you care for the characters no matter how bad it is so watch it people before anyone spoils it for you ... It's Mind blowing ."
307," Game of Thrones at its best
",10,True,"A riveting episode, with a twist that left me speechless at the end. 'The Door', in many ways, highlights how pervasively the past lingers and colours the present, especially for members of the Stark family. This adds an element of poignancy to what is an ultimately shocking episode. We are introduced to new, compelling characters, the highlight among which is a Bravosi theatre troupe twisting the events that have previously occurred in Westeros. But plenty of time is devoted to more familiar faces as well, as we begin at The Wall, proceed to the Iron Islands and to Vaes Dorthrak, before we enter into Bran's mind, and learn the secrets that he learns. If you were disappointed with the start of Season 6, don't worry - this is where the plot thickens and the tension rises, while the action picks up."
308," After All Of These Seasons, You Would Think That Nothing Would Surprise You, You Would Be Wrong
",10,True,"Starting in the North where Sansa gets an invitation From Littlefinger, where he tries to make amends, Understandably Sansa is outraged and refuses his apology. Arya seems to be growing in strength and in wisdom. As she is assigned to kill an actress and she is reluctant to do so. The Iron Borns are trying to determine who is worthy of becoming there king, Or in our case the queen, as Yara Greyjoy steps up to claim the throne, she is blindsided by her uncle who has been piloting to take the throne for years.As usual they left the best for last as Brans story line quickly escalates into a battle for survival, As the White Walker horde surrounds the cave, Bran is forced to warg into Hodor, But he does it while he is looking back at the old memories, and as crazy as it sounds it actually works! What's more bizarre is that it leaves it's mark. Showing us where the Hodor name came from. Which is sort of a paradox, If Bran is the reason for Hodors condition, That means this had to have happened before, or after, my head hurts..."
309," After all these years...
",10,True,"... We finally know why Hodor only can say ""hodor"". And it's heartbreaking. This episode make me cry twice - first when Khaleesi learns about Jorah's condition and when she commanded him not to leave her side. And the second time when we learned what happened to Hodor, and I have to say... I have never cried this much to any movie or TV- show ever - probably because it has been such a long time coming - and I was just devastated. This episode shows that, no, GoT has not gotten worse because George is not involved anymore. This episode shows why GoT is one of the best TV-shows of all time, if not THE best. Just amazing."
310," Best Episode of Game of Thrones yet - No Spoilers
",10,True,"This episode is just a reminder of why this is absolutely the best show on TV, the quality of writing is ridiculous, there is no other piece of media in any form that makes me feel the way this show makes me feel. Absolutely astonishing in every possible way, head and shoulders above any other show or movie or book in my opinion. This show hit its stride in the first season and has rarely slowed down even a little, and when it did it consistently raced ahead later on in the season Exciting, funny, harrowing, beautiful and terrifying, saying this show has it all is an understatement. This episode (among some other notable episodes) had me in shock. 10 out of mutha-f**king 10."
311," An Explosive Ride
",10,True,"I was sitting at the very edge of my seat during the last few minutes of this episode. It was explosive, mind-blowing, and having ramifications that would completely alter the Game of Thrones universe. Bran's new ability that is revealed during the closing moments of this episode is the biggest thing in the show since the White Walker's existence was proved.The storyboarding is once again epic. The episode was perfectly paced and so is this season so far. It started off very slow and it looked like the showrunners are stalling the storyline. But now we know, it was all a perfect setup for this mid-season climax.Suffices to say, tonight's episode ranks among the very best of GoT. The storyline has finally picked up some pace this season and old mysteries are being unraveled.I definitely, look forward to next week's episode in the hope that it will continue what's been set off in 'The Door' and build on it in a massive way!"
312," This is the best 4th episode of the serie.

Dany's scene only serves the purpose for Jorah to send away to find a cure for himself. However story progresses. Arya is given another task that is to kill someone but the motive is not clear. Arya questions hesitantly and is hushed by the priest. On let me skip all that to come to the main point. Bran lures white walkers to the red tree mistakenly and then we get the scene of the year. I honestly don't have words to describe the scene but the emotional intensity is so huge that I had tears welling up. We have all come to love Hodor for what he does and learning about his past with Bran warging into him when he is young is just mind boggling. The possibilities are endless. Rest is peace Ho,Door."
314," Everything Connects
",10,True,"How can even one word mean so much?That's because George R. R. Martin, the master of worldbuilding, has unbelievably taken his incredible story to another level. Also known Sci-Fi writer, he's managed to do something amazing: Incorporate science fiction elements into a fantasy story that doesn't really need them but is even better with them.The passion and attention to detail makes up for an epic adventure but not without substance. Characters so rich that could even have their own show, even saying the word ""characters"" doesn't feel right, these are people. No good guys or bad guys, just people doing whatever they think is right or best for them.Why is Game of Thrones undeniably one of the best shows I've ever seen? Because it's one that cares so much about its story that even something as apparently meaningless as a repeated word by a seemingly comic relief character can mean more than meets the eye."
315," Such an emotional episode
",10,True,"In the very first scene, with Sansa and Littlefinger, Sansa expresses her distrust towards him and further proves to the audience that she is - finally - learning. She even learnt from him (the very best) and chose not to tell Jon about where she got her information from. Littlefinger is shown to be in great discomfort in this scene, which is a rare sight for one of the most quietly intimidating and powerful people in all of Westeros.Varys - another man of knowledge and power - was made very uncomfortable in this episode as he was confronted with his greatest fear/enemy: magic. It was so very strange seeing both Littlefinger and Varys in their states, yet it was a gentle reminder that nobody is entirely invulnerable. As a wise man once said: power resides where men believe it resides.We were also treated to another emotional, albeit short, scene with Daenerys and Jorah, in which we receive a long-awaited pardon. Jorah declares his love for Daenerys, and in return she finally forgives him for his treason. She sends him away with a (final?) mission: find a cure for his greyscale. Unfortunately, I'm not too confident that he'll actually find that cure, or even if they'll meet again, but I can only be optimistic and pray that he does and they do.Euron Greyjoy has won the King's Moot; alas, he was too late and as a result, Yara and Theon have escaped with (seemingly) all of the ships. Where will they go? Will they head over to Meereen themselves and implement Euron's plan before he can? It seems unlikely, but I'm not sure where else they can go. At least we now know Daenerys will have her ships soon!Arya's training seems to have been stunted once more. Jaqen seems very skeptical of her and her ability to serve the Many-Faced God. Perhaps, if things don't go according to plan for Arya with her next mission, we'll see her leaving Braavos sooner than expected.The final scene was completely traumatising. Bran! You mustn't linger too long or you'll drown! Do the Starks ever listen? Had he been more careful this tragedy could have been avoided. I was not expecting to see the White Walkers in this episode, nor was I expecting the death of the Three Eyed Raven, Hodor, and Summer (Bran's direwolf). We learnt how Hodor became Hodor and witnessed the tragedy unfold before us. It was honestly heartbreaking. Hodor died fighting and doing what he always had done so well: protecting Bran.I do sincerely hope that Bran has learnt enough in his time in training and that he can put to good use what he's been taught. He's one of the final pieces of the puzzle to defeating the White Walkers, so his survival is absolutely paramount.No King's Landing or Ramsay storyline in this episode, sadly, but we've next week to look forward to, and I imagine it will be quite eventful given all the tricks both Cersei and the High Sparrow have up their sleeves.This episode's culmination marks the halfway point for season six - can you believe we're here already? With only five episodes to go, I'm already starting to fear for the end of the season."
316," Wow..
",10,True,No comments. This is the first episode of GoT that made my eyes water. There were many emotional parts before and I never cried to those. Something about this episode: The acting or the background score idk. But it really made me emotional.

",10,True,"Speechless. One of the most emotionally intense episodes Game of Thrones has ever made. I thought this episode had a rocky start but then when Bran's Scene came it took a Wholly different level . And getting to know that the White Walkers are the creation of The children of the forest it was seriously mind Boggling. Well.. this has simplified the story very much. I don't think HBO can produce two more seasons because all the strings are coming together and the story has very very simplified,I think that if the producers had waited for the books they would have gotten a Richer Background But this was also very good on the writers part. If the story moves forward like it has in this season we are definitely in for the greatest ride of television of all time."
319," Heart Breaking
",10,True,This single episode maid me realize why Game Of Thrones is the most well written show of all time.
320," Hardhome pt 2
",9,True,"WOW...This episode was almost perfect...almost because there are too many things going on: 1. Littlefinger is back. He meets Sansa and Brienne and goes all weepy and confesses that he knew all about Ramsay but underestimated Sansa's ability to handle him. He also offers the Knights of the Vale for the upcoming Bastard Bowl but Sansa rejects him, which is a stupid decision since they need an army to fight the Boltons & co. Sansa sends Brienne to have her grand-uncle the Blackfish who has retaken Riverrun (the story is different from the books) while she and Jon will try to convince other Northern houses to back them up. Will Brienne face off against Jaime when he comes to Riverrun? That would be interesting...2. Having her sight restored, Arya is given an assignment. She has to poison an actress in a satirical play about the War of the 5 Kings and take her place. While scouting her target, she realizes that history is truly written by the winners as her family is constantly mocked throughout the play. She hesitates because the actress is a good person, but Jaqen lectures her that death comes for all and if she truly wishes to be a Faceless Man(?), she has to kill regardless of morality. As if she isn't already a killer...3. Lord Friendzone Jorah the Andal reveals to Dany that he is going to become a stone man soon and that he loves her (again). She orders him to seek the cure and return to her when she will conquer Westeros. Let's get out of Meereen first, Mother of Dragons.4. Tyrion decides to seek spiritual help to handle things in Meereen after things have cooled down (for now) and meets with Red Priestess Kinvara who is totally hot and cunning btw. She agrees to his T&Cs before Varys starts mocking her about Melisandre and Stannis. She ""burns"" him by almost revealing his tragic past and Varys totally freaks out, which is pretty rare. She still agrees to Tyrion's T&Cs before leaving with a smirk on her face. Damn...5. Kingsmoot aka Ironborn Parliament takes place and Yara positions herself as the Queen along with Theon's support. But Euron steals the show by revealing that he did kill Balon and he will seek Dany as his wife and her army and dragons and conquer the 7 kingdoms. He is voted King by the majority and after a drowning ceremony he is crowned. It is revealed that Yara and Theon and their supporters have stolen the best ships and fled. Euron vows revenge. Please no Dorne again...6. Bran and his visions. WOW. If the episode had been only focused on this, it would have been 10/10. The reveal that the CHILDREN OF THE FOREST CREATED THE WHITE WALKERS.... OH YEAH.Bran tries to go solo and stumbles upon the army of the undead and The Night's King and his 3 Horsemen (Jon killed one of them in Hardhome). The Night's King touches him and he wakes up with fear. Bloodraven reveals that the WW army is coming for them, the cave cannot protect them anymore.Bran and Bloodraven are on another time buddies trip where we see kid Ned leaving off to become Jon Arryn's ward and Robert Baratheon's best bud. In the real wold aka the present, the WW army arrives and Meera and the Children hold them off for minutes at the most. One by one the Children die and Meera kills 1 Horseman with a Valyrian spear similar to Jon (Star Wars theories anyone?). Hodor is scared but as Meera tries to wake him up Bran is able to control Hodor in the present while simultaneously staying in the past vision. As Hodor, Bran, Meera and the last Child leave, Summer tries to hold the undead off but dies too.Dead direwolves - 3 (I still believe Shaggydog is alive until proved otherwise).The Night's King kills off Bloodraven, while still in a vision with Bran, is aware of the outside world and his death seconds away. He dies, disappearing in a haze. The last Child sacrifices herself (itself?) to allow Bran, Hodor and Meera to escape. Hodor holds the door as Meera runs off carrying Bran while screaming, ""Hold the door!!!"". It is revealed that Meera's screams along with Bran being in the past, caused Wylis / Walder to go mad become HODOR = HOLD THE DOOR.WOW.+ Hodor... let me wipe the manly tears. + RIP Bloodraven aka Brynden Rivers aka Three Eyed Raven aka TARGARYEN BASTARD. + BRAN CAN CHANGE THE PAST (The Mad King theory makes sense now). + Kinvara is HOT. + Hopefully Dany will leave for Westoros this season.RIP Summer. -Poor Jorah. -Too many story arcs in this episode."
321," Genius
",10,True,"Hands down, ""the door"" is my favorite GoT episode. It is absolutely genius and has all the feels in it. Credit does go to George R. R. Martin for being a literary genius with one particular character (will not spoil), but how the directors portrayed George's concept in this episode was INCREDIBLE. Not to mention how mind blowing this episode was. Two thumbs up."
322," Can It Get More Intense?
",10,True,"Others have done fine in recounting the events. I will only add that we now have the pieces there. Big battles are ahead with forces in place. Right now we don't know the relative strengths because the alliances aren't totally clear. Arya is a rogue and has her own agenda. We need to understand why she has suffered the ordeal she has; what is her motivation. Of course, the Starks want to be renewed by showing their lineage. Bran is going to be the key piece in all this. So much is revealed here as to how the white walkers have managed to become what they are. Bran has to get control of himself before he can be a force. His inquisitiveness may be his undoing. The thing with Hodor is a wonderful piece that brings knowledge to us. This season is rolling along too fast."
323," Undeniably brilliant television!
",10,True,"What a riveting episode! Game of Thrones seems to be improving by the week, and season 6 so far has been extremely satisfying simply because of the speed at which the story lines have progressed. The climax of 'the Door' was one of the most heart- wrenching and dramatic scenes in the series to date! Hodor's final sacrifice in itself is moving, following the thrilling chase through the tunnel that once seemed like a safe haven, but the discovery of the origin of his name is mind-boggling in the extreme. It opens the door (so to speak) to a range of possibilities concerning the consequences of Bran's powers, and his ability to alter past events sets an interesting paradox to be solved in future episodes. If the present as the characters are experiencing it include the alterations caused by Bran (Hodor's speech defect) then what else in the present has been inadvertently caused by Bran's actions. It truly is a fascinating question, and one I hope to see answered throughout the remainder of the season!"
324," Hold the Door
",9,True,"Every time I think this season may take a step back or give us a filler episode, it does just the opposite. Granted, there are still certain story lines that don't seem to have any impact in the larger grand scheme of things, but the good far outweighed the bad in 'The Door'.Once again beginning in Castle Black, we got to see Sansa completely shut down Littlefinger who claimed he didn't know of Ramsay's insanity at all. For someone who comes across as one of the smartest people in all of Westeros, it seems unlikely he wouldn't have heard a thing, but I guess I can buy into it. No matter, seeing Sansa shut down his offer and really come into her own as a leader of the North, was satisfying after all that she went through last season. I'm also glad to see Jon and Sansa get on the road and recruit the other houses. At the same time, I feel Brienne and Sansa's time together was all too short so I sure hope it isn't the last we see of that relationship.Continuing with the heavy Stark episode was Arya in Braavos. It's not necessarily that her scenes have been bad, they haven't. I just don't entirely see the reason why each episode we see the same sort of arc with her, Waif and Jaqen H'ghar. Arya gets her butt kicked, Jaqen doesn't trust her, and she pleads for it anyway. I thought perhaps with the comedic theatre scenes with Lady Stork we may get to see Arya in action as 'no one', but it wasn't meant to be.After Dany had a very big unburnt moment last week, she took a backseat to the Stark conflict, but it wasn't any less impactful. Seeing Jorah finally reveal his greyscale and his love for the Queen of Dragons was heartbreaking. Hearing her tell him she needs him on her side once she takes the Iron Throne was bittersweet, and it almost seems to hint that he may make it out of this season alive after all. That is, if and when he finds himself a cure.Speaking of Dany's claim to the Throne, she may have a King to rule with as Euron declared his plan to marry Daenerys and conquer all of Westeros. Meanwhile, the ""first servant of the Lord of the Light"" aka Kinvara is also looking to help Dany's claim to the throne. Whatever her plans are with Tyrion and Varys, I instantly bought into her character during her monologue to Varys. Lastly, Bran sure had a big week with his visions and flashbacks to some key plot revelations with the White Walkers. It was revealed via flashback that the Children of the Forest were directly responsible for the creation of the Night's King way back in the day. As if we thought that was big enough, it was also revealed that Bran unintentionally was the reason for Hodor's lack of intelligence. The entire sequence was beautifully edited and scored in what is one of this show's all-time great scenes/reveals. That's some season 1 story planning finally coming to fruition years later. And I can't deny how impressive the execution of this scene and this entire episode was. Season 6 just keeps getting better.+Sansa is just awesome+Iron Islands material moves along+Jorah's heartbreaking reveals+White Walker material+Hold the freaking door-Arya stuff seems repetitive9.4/10"
325," Revelations
",9,True,"Far north of the wall Bran continues to have visions with the Three-Eyed Raven; during one it is revealed just how the White Walkers came into existence. Later he decides to have a vision on his own and in it he sees the leader of the White Walkers, The Night King, and, what is more, the Night King sees him and grabs his arm. The Three-Eyed Raven tells him that that he must leave as the Night King now knows where he is and will be coming for him. As he has another vision they are attacked and we learn why Hodor says nothing but 'Hodor'. Elsewhere Sansa meets Petyr Baelish and rejects his offer of help; Yara Greyjoy claims the throne of the Iron Islands but has to flee with Theon when her Uncle Euron takes the throne. Across the Narrow Sea Arya is given another chance when she is told to kill an actress but having seen her questions whether she deserves to die.This was another great episode; interestingly the best parts included Bran, a character who had taken a relatively minor role until this season. His story provided some interesting revelations; most notably concerning the origins of the White Walkers, something I hadn't previously thought about. His story also provided some great action as the White Walker's launch their attack. After many episodes where Arya just got beaten it was nice to see her story develop; she even got to smile while watching a play about the events in Westeros at least until it included her family. The events on the Iron Islands were very interesting and served to properly introduce Euron Greyjoy; Pilou Asbæk impressed in the role; not that that was a big surprise having been previously impressed by his performances in various Danish productions. Overall as the sixth season reaches its half way point things remain as interesting as ever."
326," Despite being a ""seasoned"" viewer of drama troupes, it still made me cry, like a god damn baby
",10,True,"The troupe of ending twist that makes one re-evaluate everything they saw from another perspective isn't anything new, films like The Usual Suspects made guys like Kevin Spacey famous because of it. Nor am I anything of the teary eyed sort, especially after 6 seasons of GoT, but...God I just couldn't stop those tears.Hodor... Christ I can never look at that name again... he was low-key, we took it all for granted, despite should have known better, we took it at face value, we gave him no importance.GoT became famous because of its penchant for killing off main characters, in retrospect, that sort of shock value is easy, but for every one of our exaggerated hype over the killing of one main protagonist, how many ""insignificant"" deaths have we ignored? The unwavering smile of the cashier, the firefighters constantly on duty, the billions of insignificant individuals that collectively, silently keep the world functioning? How many of them were truly given the respect they deserve? Don't take others for granted, least of all the people who never entered your mind as anything noteworthy."
327," Hodor, Hodor, Hodor.
",10,True,"This is my first GOT review and i am writing it for the character who is popularly known as Hodor. I was amazed and hypnotized during the climax of the show when i understood the meaning of ""Hodor"". Right from 1st episode to the 65th episode many like me would have wondered about Hodor and his power and his fear during life threatening escapes and battles now we know why he was afraid during those times.This episode reflects the genius of the writer who introduced Hodor in very first season and explained his ""Hodor Behavior"" in sixth season. Now that's what i call wisdom and brilliance. Those who watch GOT and there are billions of them, like me they can understand the destined departure of this major character who performed it flawlessly. This is one of the best departure, heroic departure of a hero i have seen in this series and i am so glad that i live in the time of this legendary series. This series now belong to the world and we all are very proud of it. I believe stories like Game of Thrones stir our heart to that extent that even after witnessing the taste of fairy tale we can understand the meaning of life."
328," ""Hold the door"" is sheer perfection!
",10,True,"*SPOILER FREE*This episode is beyond amazing! I would say this is one of the most important and thrilling episodes in recent times. It would clear many of your doubts and questions, and the ending would simply give you chills. I wouldn't dare say anything about the story so I'm leaving it to you to watch and judge. I would give full points to the cinematography: every angle is beautifully shot and looks like a painting. Acting overall is brilliant. Sansa's character is becoming very interesting so I'm quite curious how much she's going to transform during this season. Bran and Hodor is phenomenal. Score is done brilliantly. Enough good to make you feel cold. Writing and directing is top notch. They can expect a lot of Emmys and probably Golden Globes this year.Now I'm curious about upcoming weeks. How they would top this one is beyond me. [10/10]."
329," Game Of Thrones – S06E05
",10,True,"This season of Game of Thrones is well and truly on fire. After so much build up in season 5, it has exploded and week after week they seem to be hitting home run for home run.This week was no different. So much happened this episode and it was all amazing. Starting we at Castle Black we got to see Sansa and Little Finger meet each other for the first time since Sansa was sent to marry Ramsey. What I really like in this scene was how even when Little Finger was under the hammer and Sansa was dishing it all out to him, he was still pulling his strings. Dropping hints and tips to Sansa that she ended up taking on board and telling Jon about when they were trying to work out how they would return Winterfell to the Stark name. Coming from this we also got the extremely entertaining scene with Brienne and Tormund. I really hope they play this out. It would be amazing to see a team up like that and together see them taking out White Walkers. While the Daenarys scene was brief it was really good. We finally got Captain Friendzone admitting his love for Daenarys, a scene that was well over due. Apart from that point, we got to see Daenarys leading an army once again. I've always liked when Daenarys is in charge and she is showing her determination and starting to build towards her end attack for the throne. We got perhaps one of my favourite fight scenes since the Mountain popped the head of The Viper. I really loved Arya's fight scene with the other faceless assassin. It was extremely brutal and the way it was choreographed was amazing and was paced really smoothly and well. Of course it wouldn't be Game of Thrones without a massive ending. Hold the Door. Finally we get to see how Hoodor transitioned from Willis to the Hoodor we know. I thought the was they did it was amazing. I really like how with Bran we are really starting to explore his powers as a Warg and are being able to see how he can influence the past. I thought the scene itself with Hoodor holding the door shut to stop the White Walkers was extremely emotional the the way they cut between present day and Bran Warging into the past was brilliant. I'm calling it now, White Walker Hoodor for the end of the season. Of course the other big things to come out of Bran's scenes is we learned how the first White Walkers were create by the tree people and that the White Walkers are now on the chase for Bran. I'm not quite sure why they are after Bran specifically but I'm sure it will all be explained in the next few weeks. Yet again, one of the most amazing episodes of the whole series has been produced out of this wonderful thing we call season 6. This is why Game of Thrones is so highly regarded as one of the best TV shows of all time and it's really good to see that not having books to based the remaining episodes off is yet to hinder the quality. 10/10"
330," The balance of power shifts in King's Landing and Arya makes an important decision.
",9,True,This episode opens shortly after the previous one ended; Meera is dragging Bran through the snow and the White Walkers are approaching fast; suddenly an unidentified rider rescues them. It later becomes apparent that it is Bran's uncle Benjen Stark; it was assumed that he died long ago but he survived north of the wall and during that time learnt more about the White Walkers. Meanwhile Sam and Gilly arrive at his home; at first they are made to feel welcome but when his father returns the atmosphere turns frosty then gets even colder when he learns that Gilly is a Wildling. In King's Landing Jaime and the Tyrell forces move to rescue Queen Margaery but are thwarted when it emerges that King Tommen and Margaery are now siding with High Sparrow. Elsewhere Walder Frey is determined to retake lands lost to 'Blackfish' Tully. Across the Narrow Sea Arya chooses not to kill the actress she was instructed to kill; something that will put her life in danger in the not too distant future. As Daenerys and her Dothraki march to Meereen she is reunited with one of her dragons and gives a stirring speech to her followers.There may not be lots of action in this episode but that doesn't mean it is boring. The opening provides the episode's main action as well a serving to introduce a character we assumed was dead. The scenes at Sam's family home were suitably tense without any real sense of danger; Hannah Murray and John Bradley put in fine performances as Gilly and Sam. The events in King's Landing were intriguing and served to shake things up nicely as the balance of power shifted very suddenly. Arya's scenes were really good; they also mean that her character's development is going to change direction as she deliberately disobeys her instructions. Maisie Williams did a great job playing the role in a way that meant that her move was neither too obvious nor too surprising. We have seen Daenerys give plenty of stirring speeches to various followers over the years but they are still a great way to end an episode; especially when she is sat astride a massive dragon. Overall I really enjoyed this episode and look forward to seeing how things develop.
331," I've had it with Dany
",7,False,"Game of Thrones has showed consistency throughout its 6 seasons. It's almost a given that after a great episode such as last weeks' The Door, the following episode would consist on story development.I like to see this show progress the way its characters think and act, so I had no problems with this episode that brings back a lot of characters from other seasons, such as: Walder Frey, Black Fish and Benjen Stark.However, Daenery's story line is becoming dull, I'm tired of seeing her conquer small cities and remembering us that she is the rightful heir to the Iron Throne. I believe that showing her so INCREDIBLE and UNSTOPPABLE so many times has made her too constant and boring. I want to see her face a big army where she has to sacrifice several ""banner men"" in order to succeed and rule, not just burn a couple of Khals and then intimidate everyone with her dragons.... TOO REPETITIVE.Another solid episode, not too much action going on.7/10"
332," Blood of my Blood
",9,True,"There has been a large amount of criticism directed towards this episode due to comparisons to The Door, one of the greatest Game of Thrones episodes of all time. However, Blood Of My Blood is a strong episode that should not be held back due to the previous episode's overwhelming success. I'll mention my three personal favourite story lines from this episode, as I highly encourage you to watch 606 for yourself.Coldhands save Bran and Meera from wights after their escape from the cave. Bran is having visions of previous events from within the series, along with some brief scenes of The Mad King, Daenerys' father. It is revealed that Coldhands is indeed Benjen Stark, a character that all Thrones fans have missed dearly.The King's Landing storyline was well done. Margaery convinces Thommen into accepting the High Sparrow's religious views and way of life, or this could all be a clever attempt to overthrow the faith and reinstate order back into the capital. Jaime is sent to deal with Blackfish at Riverrun.Arya finally gets some action. After watching incredibly biased and false reenactments of the Bravosi take on the Purple Wedding, Arya ventures backstage and forms a friendship with the woman portraying Cersei Lannister, the one whom she was sent to kill. Arya makes the right decision and turns rouge, refusing to kill the actress and digging up Needle from it's hiding spot.The Good: - Arya's decision - Sam meeting with his family and claiming Hearthsbane - The return of Benjen Stark - Sets up momentum for a conflict in King's Landing - Gives North and Mereen story lines a break The Okay: - Little action, but makes up for it with strong dialogue - Anti-climatic scene between Tyrells vs Faith Militant The Bad: - Daenerys is my second favourite character...but really?! Stop prolonging her storyline, leave her out of episodes if you have to! Feels like the show is overusing her, bring back her meaningful conversations with her advisors and battles with the slavers, her motivational speeches are repetitive. Hope to see her get some very strong scenes in the last four episodes.Not as strong as the last two amazing episodes, maybe on par with Oathbreaker.8.8/10"
333," Last scene ruins it for me
",9,True,"You have to know I don't usually do reviews and I don't write English well. This is the best episode of season 6 in terms of writing. it started where it ended last episode Bran was saved by his missing uncle and little explanation of why he never came back to the wall, but not much info of what's going on with Bran at least not yet! We finally seen development from Arya! A girl well never be no one. Sam meets his family and his bad father who didn't take him time to find a reason to throw him out but this time it comes with a price with Sam taking one of the oldest valuable swords. High sparrow win and this time he wins the king. He is smarter than I thought. Tommen started to make decisions.Finally Ending the episode with the cheapest writing of Daenerys like ""How many ships we need to sail to westeros?"" Daario respond ""A thousand ship"" WOW just exactly what Euron Greyjoy thinking, it like Euron knows exactly what Daenerys needs and he's going to build them faster than you think, and that scene with the dragon are you kidding me ? is that what writers saving the budget for? they killed wolfs and sir Barristan for this? A 30s dragon show off and a boring speech we've heard ""A thousand"" time"
334," A wonderful episode transition crowned with a great scene.
",9,True,"A beautiful episode transition. Great development of Sam arches, Arya and Daenerys. Although King's Landing has been anticlimactic, it demonstrated the ability of articulation and great strategic thinking of the High Sparrow, always masterfully played by Jonathan Pryce. Arya realize the injustice practiced by faceless men, and decides finally resume his Stark identity represented by the needle. Sam can, after two decades, to empower and make a decision that will influence your life, Gilly and baby. After so much suffering faced by Stark, it is strange to see that one of them survived. Oh, Walder Frey, and want you to die. Jaime seem to really regressed as a character and again turned marionette Cersei. And as icing on the cake, a small number of Bran views and a great scene of Daenerys."
335," brilliant episode
",10,True,"This is an amazing episode... Don't lower your spirits by what others are saying... If you want gore, nudity and violence, this episode is gonna be a bore for you... If you want good acting and storytelling, you are in for a treatThe High Sparrow strikes in a very different way. I like how his subtle actions are actually helping many people. Cersei has become a stronger calmer person, Tommen has got some goal in his life, Margaery has become an even better person and the city itself has come closer to the crown... No more riots people.Benjen Stark is Back! Perhaps not the way we wanted him to return, but this way is more realistic than him being Coldhands or Daario... Arya's story line goes on a barrel role. I always expected her to go against the Sparrows and return to Westeros, but i didn't expect it to happen so soon.No Jon or Sansa, but their absence was made up by Sam and Gilly, who finally have exciting plotsFinally, The Blackfish!! And Jamie's gonna follow the story line... The reason why I'm excited because this paves the way for .... wait- for- it ... Lady Stoneheart people! Cant wait"
336," More Irons in the Fire
",8,True,"A few random events. This is a transitional episode. We have Sam and Gilly arriving at his father's castle. He is humiliated by the overbearing ass of a father and Gilly defends him, only to be further maligned. Now we move to Queen Margery and the King, who is an indecisive ass and who falls for the Sparrow's monkeyshines. He gets to see Margery and as the Tyrell's arrive to keep her from taking that fateful walk, he walks out on the steps with her, swearing allegiance to that pack of wolves who act in the name of their god. There is further action with Bran and a rescue. Finally, Dany is back in the saddle (the one on the dragon, who has now healed). Arya chooses to return to the living and takes her sword back (the cool thing is her incredible training). So now it will be a week again to get back to the heavy lifting. Cersei is biding her time, like the snake under the rock. Fascinating that we are actually pulling for her these days."

Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.""Blood of My Blood"" is something of a let-down after two incredible episodes in ""Book of the Stranger"" and ""The Door"". It is still a very well done episode though, despite having some faults, and to be honest following on from episodes as good as those two is daunting and for it to be on the same level would have been a monumental challenge. It doesn't achieve this challenge/feat completely, but it almost like because of the good elements being so good. There are faults here. Have to agree that Daenerys' role in the episode is dull and neither plot-progressing or develops her character much, her speech doesn't really stir the spirits either. Tommen's character needs to become more interesting because there is not enough to him yet to make him a love to hate him character, at the moment he's fairly ordinary. Jaime's development seems to have gone backwards rather than progressed. Pacing is occasionally a bit slow. However, there is a huge amount that works in ""Blood of My Blood"" that stops it from being bloodless. It is not as eventful or as tight pace-wise as the previous two episodes and revelations and such are milder and don't have the same amount of punch. The episode does do a great job with Sam and Gilly as well as the character of Benjen. Standing out just as much is the story with High Sparrow and Arya's character and story is progressing and the most interesting it was up to this point. Can't fault the acting. Jonathan Pryce was always great as High Sparrow, he's superb here. Maisie Williams is another standout, and Sam and Gilly are splendidly characterised.Visually, ""Blood of My Blood"" looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about ""Blood of My Blood"" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film. The end scoring is especially powerful. Plenty of layers, passion and sensitivity in the writing if not quite consistent. In conclusion, could have been much more but very well done on the most part. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
338," good but not spectacular
",7,False,"Too many weak moments in this episode for it to be a spectacular episode. enough good moments for it to be a good episode. the weak moments were the end scene where its now become so predictable and there's no real character development involving Dany, there's also no in depth political issues regarding Dany the most in depth they go is Meereen with Tyrion, they need to show Dany struggling for power her having to endure more personal conflict, more infighting then the end scene where she conquers a city wont seem so boring and draining. Arya becomes a ""Stark"" again which is excellent. they've made her re galvanize hope again the bit where she gets needle back is excellent. they've somewhat copied they done with Sansa where they made her character suffer and they then seek the help of others to shy away from being who they really are then they figure out who they are again. the difference is they made Arya's route a lot more subtle and a lot more empathizing for me. they've made Jaime regress, he's back to the illogical,irrational over confident character, the one who people hated, hes resorting to violence firs where as before he was a lot calmer and more logical when planning. Tommen is looking really weak as a character, he seems very conflicted with himself with his beliefs and you almost get the feeling that the writers don't actually have a proper story for him and they are just throwing him in there with the high sparrow vs Lannisters and Tyrells battle. loved the opening scenes with Sam and Gilly you finally learn more about who Sam is, you see the resentment that's there between him and his father and you can see him becoming stronger as a character each season. him taking the sword and leaving his father's castle just shows now he has really strengthened as a character. overall good not spectacular."
339," An odd and quite small episode of Game of Thrones
",10,True,"For a while, I was thinking of not reviewing this episode at all since there's nothing really mind-blowing about it, and upon first watching ""Blood of My Blood"", I was rather disappointed with the episode, which is what I expected, coming off of last week's near-perfect episode. However, when I sat down with my parents and watched it for a second time, I realised that this episode is much better than I remembered as it executes just about everything it does flawlessly and it really is a perfect example of how Game of Thrones is great at drama as well as violence and fantasy. It dials back on the momentum that previous episodes had and lets its story lines take their time, making it a rather small & self-contained episode that mainly comprises of just three major story lines; Arya's, King's Landing's and Sam's. Also, it perfectly meshes humour & tension with Sam's story-line whilst giving us a few surprises with the King's Landing plot and it sets up an exciting next episode for Arya. We get surprise returns from three characters that have been absent from the show for years, and the episode ends on a spectacular note, reminding us why this show is so special. Overrall, this episode is a neat little gem and while it won't be remembered as one of Thrones' greats, it's still a fantastic episode that effortlessly blends fantasy and drama, whilst also balancing a few twists & turns with setup that makes me eager for the next episode. My score for the episode: 9.6/10."
340," a belated effort to get back on track
",6,False,"This episode marks an effort by the show to get two story lines closer to book developments that had been ignored: one by introducing us to Bran's new companion and two, by removing Jaime from King's Landing.In the first case, the appearance of Coldhands/Benjen Stark is welcome. Of course, introducing him 3(?) seasons too late is weird. If anything, the show is forced to reveal his identity immediately because who would remember the guy who appeared for 2 minutes in season 1? His showing up when he did feels a little forced, but in any case is sure to provide some interest in Bran's plot.The King's Landing story on the other hand is a little shaky. The idea of Margaery and Tommen being converted (?) by the High Sparrow is unconvincing, but not without interest. That Jaime is off to Riverrun (under vastly different circumstances and timing than in the book) - to help Walder Frey, who reappears - may move his shambling character forward, but only after he has been used by the show to demolish several other plot lines, from Dorne to, most lamentably, his own. Still no sign of friction between him and Cersei.Arya appears to do what we all knew would happen - reclaim her true identity. Which happens without much being gained, other than wasting a whole lotta time. We now wait to see how she will defeat the other faceless girl who has beaten the crap out of her a gazillion times.Sam's awkward return to the Tarly household was well played. The guy who plays Randyll Tarly has a perfectly disgusted face. Not sure about Sam taking Gilly and stealing Heartsbane though. Kinda defeats the point.And then we have Daenerys. Another - YET another - episode ends with a supposedly epic Daenerys scene. Yet again I felt like throwing up. Yes, that is mostly because I despise her character. But allow me to elaborate on more solid grounds:Theon is Ramsay's prisoner. His badass sister sails around a continent with a band of ironborn cutthroats to save him. They are chased away by a naked Marquis de Sade and a couple of dogs. Daenerys gets captured by a horde of Dothraki. Two swashbucklers infiltrate the city, murder a few guards unnoticed while Her Incompetence murders the Dothraki leaders inside their holy city. Everyone follows her in ecstasy. See a difference? Robb Stark breaks off an engagement. Half his commanders turn on him. All hell breaks loose. Daenerys commits murder and sacrilege. Everyone is happy. Then she rides a dragon she couldn't control and convinces the Dothraki to cross the sea.This is unfair storytelling. Some characters get what's coming to them. Others are unlucky. Others still get a lucky break. Once. And some suffer no (logical) consequences, are saved in bizarre and unlikely ways, never get in trouble for longer than a very little while, and are treated (by other characters) entirely unrealistically, with the sole purpose of being built up as some sort of epic hero (or villain in the case of the even less sensible Ramsay plot line). Well, no. No matter what happens in the future, this is very poor and unbalanced narrative. No one enjoys it when the game is rigged."
341," The Game of Thrones Fandom Has Become Toxic
",1,False,"It is beyond my level of comprehension how each episode this season has been praised by the fandom as if this show is flawless. It is very perplexing that the last episode of my once favourite show had actually received a 9.8. I mean, do people actually believe that episode was better than; Ned Starks execution, the battle of Blackwater, the Viper vs the Mountain, Tywin's death and much more? I mean, this whole season wanes in comparison when looking at every other previous season (excluding season 5 of course, which is only slightly better than this one). A user stated last week that reading the reviews on this godforsaken site will put you in a state of trauma, and I'm inclined to agree. And look where that users review is now, flagged down into the last page with every other truthful review. It seems like IMDb has become a site in which truthful and honest reviews are disregarded and flagged down as not helpful all because the GOT fandom can't handle criticism. In previous seasons, people were able to highlight some of the shows shortcomings without fear of being suppressed and censored. Now the fandom disregards the truth and sings the same bs praise each and every other episode. It is appalling. While I do not truly believe the episode is a 1, I have to give it this review to negate a least one positive review and a least bring some semblance of sense to this night's overrated episode. With all that being stated, let me begin on my list of grievances for this night's episodeSpeaking in terms of plot progression, nothing significant happened in this episode whatsoever. I mean, the whole point of Sam bringing Gilly to High Heart was so she could stay there while he became a maester. That's what happens in the book at least because he can't take her to the citadel. Instead in this episode Sam takes her to High Heart, only to say no and end up taking her to the Citadel anyways. Please give me a break. Sam's character arc is able to progress just fine without Gilly needing to be a part of it. Also, am I supposed to believe that the biggest coward in the series, Sam, would steal his father's sword Heartsbane? We are talking about Randyll Tarly here. Randyll Tarly would hunt Sam down and gut the POS alive if he even had the audacity to touch his valyrian steel sword. But in the show nope. Sam can apparently steel a rare Valyrian steel sword and leave unscathed.Also, the best part of Tommen in the novels is the fact that he is very young and pretty much incapable of making decisions for himself. As a result, it is up to Cersei to make up the bulk of his decisions which is why the Kings Landing plot is so intriguing in the books. Instead, the show allows Tommen to forge a peace with the High Sparrow. WOW. The same group of people that have been victimizing the Lannister's for season 5 and onwards. Whatever. Then Tommen is apparently bold enough to remove Jaime from Lord Commander of the Kings Guard? Get out of here with that illogical nonsense.In addition to this, Arya's plot just nosedived into absolute nonsense. What was the point in training Arya to become a faceless man for the past 1 season and a ½? I mean, there was absolutely no point in doing this if she was just going to leave the faceless men. And why do it after all of this time? She had multiple opportunities to do so and just now she develops a conscience and decides she can't kill people? Arya is a remorseless killer who has been victimized the entire series. Based on her plot in the novels and what we have seen of her in the shows, she wouldn't hesitate to make a kill for the faceless men, even if that person happened to be innocent. Then we have an absolutely irrelevant and pretentious scene in which Dany flaunts her dragon and makes yet another pretentious speech where she talks about conquering. Of great, as if we didn't have enough of those. And then she states she needs specifically 1000 ships in order to get to Westeros. WOW! Who could have guessed that! Its not like Euron began assembling 100 ships last episode. What a coincidence! D&D obviously don't give their viewership enough credit and think they have to spell everything out for people.The only redeeming parts of the episode was Bran and the reintroduction of Walder Frey. The reintroduction of Walder Frey and sending Jaime to the Riverlands is good as it looks like they are trying to get back in line with what occurs in the novels. Brans storyline was decent as they finally reintroduce Benjen after 6 seasons and we can finally see what is going to occur with him.Like I stated above, while do not believe this episode to be a 1, I have to give it this rating in order to negate one positive review and bring balance to the overrated episode as it is currently sitting at a flawless 10. I understand my reviews are an open invitation to be flagged down as not helpful, so continue to be ignorant towards my reviews fandom. Anyways, I've done enough ranting. Goodbye."
342," Stop stalling the main storyline
",5,False,"I find it surprising that a show centering on intrigue and action, cannot continue from where it left off. We had a great episode last week, and this week's episode kind of falls flat. Primarily, because it was acting as a filler episode with no viable progression of storyline. And that is not a bad thing in its own right but on GoT it feels like the showrunners are deliberately stalling matters.That being said, this episode wasn't completely dull. It had its moments - we visit the Tarlys and Benjen Stark is reintroduced as Coldhands. The rest of the episode is forgettable, to say the least. We don't visit most of the places critical to the major story arc - Winterfell, Castle Black, and the Vale.Furthermore, I have had my issues with Dany but she is getting quite unbearable of late. The showrunners are throwing her in every episode, even if she doesn't have any logical storyline to build upon.Conclusively, it feels like Game of Thrones is trying too hard to build suspense where it is not needed, and unduly emphasizing content that has no significant impact on the main storyline. The showrunners should stop treating us as brain-dead fans who can be appeased by one great action scene every other episode. Instead, they should make episodes with substance."
343," Game of Thrones haters don't understand what toxic means...
",10,True,"Personally, in my opinion, I think Game of Thrones is the best programme on TV and it is well worth watching, even if you're not a fan of Fantasy. Whilst Game of Thrones has a fair share of drama, it also exhibits a good amount of action as well, and captivates viewers with its crazy plot twists and exciting story.The only reason to steer clear is if you're sensitive to violence or nudity, or if you're too young. If you're okay with that, I seriously recommend giving it a try, if it doesn't catch your interest straight away just keep watching.This show is an excellent show, and I'm tired of idiots rating it 1/10 just because something happens that doesn't go their way, despite still liking the rest. ""while do not believe this episode to be a 1, I have to give it this rating in order to negate one positive review and bring balance to the overrated episode as it is currently sitting at a flawless 10""This is the most pathetic statement I've seen on IMDb... he wants to rate the show badly because he wants to negate other people's opinions? What? This show isn't rated based only off his opinion, he shouldn't get butt-hurt because other people enjoyed the episode and rated it good.What really irks me about this stupid review is that it's titled ""The Game of Thrones Fandom Has Become Toxic,"" aside from me making this reply, of course, this statement is so ironic. He has the audacity to call a whole lot of people toxic whilst simultaneously whining about how his opinion should matter more than others, so is unnecessarily hating on the show.Even worse, he says that he doesn't actually believe it to be a 1, but rates the whole show that because later seasons aren't going the way he wants them to, and because people that enjoy the show are rating it good. This is just the most toxic attitude in my opinion and I'm fed up of other people hating on things unnecessarily due to being butt- hurt about the show being rated better than presumably their other favourite show (which is implied by the ratings of other shows when I viewed his profile.)Anyway, sorry about my rant to those here looking for reasons to watch Game of Thrones, steer clear of people hating the show as they just want it to be rated lower than their favourite TV show."
344," Hi, i am a review, nice to meet you
",1,False,"The rating for this episode is surprisingly low, right now at 8.4. How come, one might ask according to the fact the ratings for the other episodes are almost near the 10.0 mark. Well, let us guess what may be the reasons for this: No John Snow. Oh my God! This cannot be true, for it seems as if the whole reason for GOT to exist is this character alone. The media made such a fuss about his death (and the following, not really very surprising resurrection)that the average superficial viewer must get the impression that he has to be in every single scene of this show.Just remember how people shared all their grief about him being killed, ""Oh my God, gotta share my sadness throughout the whole internet, so everyone will realize that i am an important person and totally hip etc."" *sigh*No Tyrion. If not Mr. Snow, than at least that cute little and highly intelligent dude has to be there. His dialog gets worse every new season, but once one has gained a certain image, people will keep that impression of that person on the basis of former seasons, no matter how much nonsense actually is being spoken in the present.Not enough action. Yeah, who cares for the story, we wanna see blood and guts, that is why we are here. Right, guys? No! But most of you want to see people get cut in two, so you can feel better and think stuff like: ""If i could only do this to my stupid boss, my annoying mother-in-law, my partner, my...."". Most viewers do not like characters to be developed. They like to see them butchered, slowly and painfully.And of course, the Nr. 1 reason: No titties! Oh no, no naked (please fill in the name of your favourite object of masturbation)! This might be the most possible of all reasons why this episode was rated so low, compared with the other ones.Your humble writer actually did not dislike this episode as much as all the ones before. The reason why i give it only one star can be read in the last section of the review from the user ""evenbro"". By the way, it really is a shame that his reviews are being voted down so heavily. People who really are interested in explaining in detail why they did not like something seem to be viewed as troublemakers these days. You have to looooooooove a movie, a band, an artist etc. up to a point where it becomes simply mindless worshiping. The slightest hint of criticism is considered as blasphemy, and the critic is treated as an outcast. Like or die, seems to be motto of this time we are living in.P.S. Pardon my English, it is not my native language. P.P.S. Daenerys,you personified deus ex machina, shut the hell up! No more speeches, please, i am begging you!"
345," wtf was that?
",1,False,"Read the books and watched the show, this was the first episode i would have rather not watched. I cringed for most of it, it was boring with cliché lines ""did they hurt you etc"" . The show for the first time looked like i was watching a normal show and not a high budget movie. Brans story line was good, but lasted very few minutes while we had loads of Sam's family, Tomman being a coward and pointless talking. And they showed the Tyrell army in the trailer only to have them withdraw cause tommon joined the faith in the show, why? its like they want viewers to hate the show. At this point they might as well copy and paste Daenerys' speeches to save money, it's the same and seems like they can't do without a ""i will take back what is mine"" from her at least every other episode. considering the claims that this season cost $10million per episode, this was disappointing."
346," Incredible to say the least
",10,True,"Greetings from Lithuania.How to collide multiple story lines brilliantly and fascinatingly in one episode? ""Blood of My Blood"" in the Answer. I do not know what many of You guys saw in this episode that currently holds low 8,6 rating (in terms of this show) here at IMDb, but this episode blew me away - it is pure 10/10. Acting, directing, script, pacing (!) and all technical stuff are on the highest order - as (almost) always. There are multiple story lines here, which moved story forward - not hold it in the same path for a minute, and it was done in brilliantly crafted and unpredictable but always plausible ways. This season 6 doesn't take a break for an episode and it is one of the few best seasons yet, and ""Blood of My Blood"" in a one helluva ride. LOVED IT."
347," Not nearly as perfect, but still great
",9,True,"Blood of My Blood isn't nearly as solid as the last four episodes, but it's still great. My only two disappointments is that the pacing felt really uneven and could've used some fixing, but everything else was fine.The performances continue to shine, the story is still well-written with a nice twist in the story-arc for Arya, the script is really good and there are some great moments. The sets are still great, the new characters are well introduced, especially the family of Samwell, the person who join the Night's Watch in the last five seasons. The scenery is still gorgeous, the editing is really nice, and Ramin Djawadi continues to deliver some fine music.So, overall, not nearly as perfect as the last four episodes, but still great and worth-recommended. :)"
348," Game of Thrones - S06E06
",8,True,"Coming off the massive Hodor moment last episode, I never expected this episode to be straight out amazing. Overall it was a really solid episode. While not a lot happened and there was no big death or reveal, it was still a very well put together episode that allowed us to take a bit of a back seat and started to invest us into the remained of the season.What they have done this season which I've loved is continue the character from the previous episode into the first scenes of the next. I think this season they are trying to make a show that if people were going to go an binge it and watch episodes on end, that the season would feel more like a 10 hour movie similar to what Marvel has done with Daredevil and Jessica Jones. That did that again with Bran, continuing him on from the Hodor moment that ended last episode. I've also like how the story arc you see at the start of the episode is usually picked up later in the episode and continues on. I think the way they are planning their episodes and the placement of all the story lines has been great this season.I think my favourite scenes from this episode was with Sam and Gilly and his family. We get to meet yet another king and get to see a family dynamic we haven't really seen in Game of Thrones. We always knew that Sam was disowned by his father but it was great to actually see it. I thought it was a great character development moment with Sam in these scenes alone. At first we saw the timid Sam getting abused by his father but by the end he makes the decision to take Gilly with him and take the sword that is rightfully his. I hope they really explore this story a bit more and I hope this isn't the last we have seen from Papa Sam.I really liked the Ayra scenes in this episode. I always thought she was eventually going to turn her back on the faceless assassin and in this episode she did. I've really liked how the other girl who has been trainer her has been gunning for Ayra this whole time and never believed in her. It is really shown throughout all the training sequences and we finally get to see what it all comes to in the last few episodes. I really liked the play aspect last week and I thought it was fantastic again this week. I like how through the play they were able to create an emotional moment with Ayra. Already this season we have had Sansa and Jon come back together and had the reappearance of Rickon. For me I think they are trying to head towards a Stark reunion and I feel of all the Stark children, Ayra has had one of the biggest journeys since leaving Winterfell.I really loved the ending to this episode. Daenarys story line has fantastically capped off two episode so far this season and I feel like her story is starting to build once again. I was really disappointed with her story last season but its been fantastic seeing her become a conquer again this season. The power she had in this final scene with her dragon was amazing and it really made me excited to see how her story is going to fold out for the remained of the season.8/10"
349," Very Mediocre Episode
",6,False,"I am really disappointed to see this episode. it was way behind GOT standards. it seems it became very easy to predict whats coming up on the show, which previously was not the case. It was so obvious Benjen is coming to rescue Bran. although i loved the flashbacks Bran got, at least we got something of the past the show has not shown to us.The twist by the High Sparrow was fantastic, even Lady Olenna was clueless of what has just happened. i haven't seen the Lannisters and Tyrells more weak at a point than this episode. Lannisters are no longer a house to be feared of. Lannisters are at lowest point of their life. i think Jaime has to leave the bed with Cersie and start doing something and be a man.I didn't understand leaving Tyrion and Jon out of this episode. both of them are so much followed by fans leaving them out might not be a good decision.and Finally Danaerys Storm Targaryan.. wow it was so awfully planned the arrival of Dragon. she just went for a pee and came back riding a Dragon. seriously? and before she arrived on dragon it seems the Dothraki's are also not happy at her leaving them behind, and suddenly when she appeared they looked all loyal to the blood to her.it could have been much better."
350," The Alliance of the Crown and the Faith
",7,False,"Beyond the Wall, Bran and Meera are rescued from a wight attack by a mysterious stranger. Gilly and Sam go to Horn Hill and are welcomed by his mother and sister. However when they are having dinner, his father Randyll discovers that Gilly is a Wildling and insults the couple. Tommen meets the High Sparrow that allows him to visit Margaery and she confesses that she repented her sins. Out of the blue, Jaime commands the Tyrell army through King's Landing to release Margaery and Loras, but he is surprised by the revelation of an alliance of the Faith and the Crown. In Braavos, Arya meets Lady Crane and they have a conversation about acting. Then Arya saves the actress from poisoning. However Waif witnesses her behavior and reports to Jaqen that asks her to kill Arya. Meanwhile Arya retrieves the Needle from the hidden place on the rocks and brings it to her room. Daenerys and Daario have a conversation about the number of ships she needs to cross the Narrow Sea with her army. Then she leaves him and returns riding Drogon. ""Blood of My Blood"" is the sixth episode where Arya finally has an attitude about Jaqen orders. The segment with Bran with his visions is annoying. Sam and Gilly are offended and now they will live outside Horn Hill. The alliance between The Crown and the Faith by the silly Tommen will be certainly destroyed by Jaime. The speech of Daenerys riding Drogon is the best moment of this show. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Blood of My Blood"""
351," Great episode
",8,True,"Blood of my Blood is another great episode of the brilliant season 6, but is a slightly lesser achievement that the previous episodes. While it still has its twists and turns, with some great moments thrown in there, however it is, well ... slightly dull in parts.Like episode one, many characters are shoehorned into this episode, and with the absence of Tyrion, this episode does't have much humour. The episode starts off spectacularly, with Bran running into a new ally. This part was very well done, with a fantastic action scene thrown in there.Next we see Sam and Gilly, whom we have not seen in a few weeks. They arrive at his father's castle, and this scene too was very entertaining, but very rushed. The dinner scene that played out was very well done, with Sam's father coming across as very intimidating. But it is all wasted as the scenes feel too rushed and not very important.The part I was really looking forwards to was Jamie and House Tyrell coming to the Queen's rescue, and to confront the High Sparrow. I was a little disappointed. It was, like most of the episode, rushed. While the writing was great here, I wanted more of a confrontation, rather than people dressed up. The biggest complaint about this scene however, was the very obvious green-screen effect in the background. This is very unlike Game of Thrones, as they have such a great budget, but the CGI in this episode was poor.Now this episode is called Blood of my Blood, and it fits this episode perfectly, as it could reference both Bran's story line, or Dany's. And Dany's scenes were, also rushed out. This part was also very disappointing, as not only did nothing really happen, but how come we only saw like 100 Dothraki soldiers? This is another example in why it seems like they did not spend much time on this episode. I am sure there is an explanation for this, like keeping their budget for another ground breaking episode like the one before. We also finally get to see the dragon again, and the CGI on him is dreadful. I was watching it and all I could think was, the dragons looked better in season 2 than here. However this is still a great episode, and it is the weakest out of season 6 so far, but it is also understandable considering the episode that we had before, it was unlikely that they would top that.8.5/10"
352," Reminded me of the earlier GOT episodes
",9,True,"I've been reading a lot of people's opinions on this episode, with some calling it boring, others slow, but to me, I was reminded of Game of Thrones back during seasons 1 and 2. This builds up epic battles which will be taking place in the next few episodes and the tension here is spectacular. Without any spoilers, this episode starts of brilliantly, with an arrival of someone that made me smile from ear to ear. The Jon and Sansa's storyline was also very good here, as it will pay off when the big battle arrives. The scenes at Kings Lander were not all that important, with some good lines thrown in there, but little happening, but still enough to hold your interest.The Arya scenes were very well done, but very rushed. All of the episodes this season have been way too short, and there feels like they could have had time for some more scenes. However the best part about this episode is its build up, every character we see if thrown in a cliffhanger of sorts. Also the production this episode was outstanding, the sets the beautiful landscapes and new regions we have never seen before, were done so well. This is a slow episode but it is by far not boring, it was like the older episodes that built up tension that will pay off soon. 9/10"
353," It's Never too Late to Come Back
",9,True,"Ah, the joy of seeing a fan favorite character return never fails to lift my spirits. The return of 'The Hound' has been heavily rumored for a while now, and the 'The Broken Man' title seemed like the perfect time to bring him back. Fortunately, The Hound wasn't the only great thing about this episode as it was a strong return to the greatness that has been this season of Game of Thrones.So it turns out Ian McShane's role this season was indeed a one-off as the acting legend was the man responsible for saving Sandor The Hound Clegane after his misstep with Brienne at the end of season 4. As different of a man as was attempting to be with the village, it sure seems like he will return to his killing ways the next time we see him as every single one of the people he was living with are now dead at the hands of the brotherhood.More fun interactions came from the Queen of Thorns this week as she tried to bargain with Margaery. I think we all knew Margaery was playing Tommen and the High Sparrow, but slipping her grandmother the picture of the rose seems like the final clue we need. She is out for revenge and I can only hope revenge is what she will get. No one wants the High Sparrow gone more than me.Olenna Tyrell also got to sass her way out of the conversation with Cersei and basically blame everything bad that has happened in Kings Landing on her. Can we really disagree with Olenna? Cersei is at the brunt of the entire 'Faith' problem. It will be interesting to see just how she sneaks her way out of this one. If the fans had it their way, the trial by combat for Cersei's freedom would involve both Clegane's, so The Hound would have to move pretty fast to Kings Landing.Some more sass came from the debut of Lyanna Mormont and boy was it entertaining. Of course, we all want to see Sansa and Jon rally all of the North against the Bolton's, but having a young girl be one of their toughest obstacles was a pleasantly surprising route to go. As much as Jon and Sansa tried to play the family card with her, Lyanna wasn't budging. Luckily, Daavos came in for the save. With the 'Battle of the Bastards' just two episodes away, the Starks are going to have to come up with a few more lucky tricks up their sleeve.It had been a while since we had seen the Tully's or the Frey's in the show, so last week's tease didn't really get me excited for Jaime's trip to see Blackfish this week. With that said, the King- slayer's scene with Blackfish was a marvel to watch. One-up after one-up between the two ended with Blackfish having the slight upper- hand although I can't see it ending anything other way but death in battle. On a side note, how great was it seeing Bronn back? Even if it was for just for a few quips. Last but not least we got to see a few scenes in Braavos with Arya. Sadly, her planned trip 'home' isn't look like it's going to happen too soon with Waif nearly stabbing her to death. I don't know who can possibly come and save her but perhaps Lady Crane can help return the favor after what Arya did for her last week. Either way, it sure seems like every storyline is coming to a breaking point, which is exciting. Even with Yara and Theon, who got a small scene this week, they seem set on sailing to Meereen to help Daenerys, which would set up great things to come in season 7. Overall, a great episode with new and old characters shining and setting up what's to come in the final 3 episodes this season. +The fricking Hound+Queen of Thorns +Margaery scheming+Lyanna Mormont+The North is reminded+Bloody Braavos sequence-Still not entirely sure about this Blackfish situation9.0/10"
354," Finally back to the real GoT
",9,True,"It's my first review, and I am writing it because this episode pleasantly surprised me.It was surprising how little cheesiness was in this episode compared to others in this season. And the dialogue was so much better, with some of Blackfish's quotes taking the top. And the final scene was really WTF for me, it contained the raw realism that Game of Thrones is known for. Overall, I haven't checked if they changed a director or screenwriter or something since the last change, but the approach is quite different and true to canon. It looks like someone who knows what GoT is about did it. Certainly not looking like a fan-fiction."
355," The Art of Revenge
",9,True,"Firstly, Never has the first 60 seconds of a TV series hit me as hard as I have been hit tonight. It's been a strange 'Game' of late, with so many significant characters falling to the sword (or bolts). So to see the Hound, one of the best GOT characters ever return was honestly profound. Despite the major shock of the Hound's return being an astronomical moment in the series, the rest of the episode didn't disappoint either. Finding out what we expected all along, that Margaery was plotting against the High Sparrow certainly wasn't a surprise, but it was a significant moment in the show. We also got a well written confrontational scene between the Queen of Thorns and Cersei, A scene that may also foretell of a darker future for the Queen of Thorns based off Cersei's reaction.However for me the real highlight of this episode was the much needed return of Bronn. Bronn's return ensures the return of the wit that has been so lacking this year, but also tells of an interesting future for his character. Whilst Arya also isn't in the best of places having been stabbed by Waif, i feel fairly certain she won't face fatal repercussions and it isn't a significant moment in the series. Lastly i'll return to where I began, with the ""Broken Man"", Sandor Clegane. That ending was dark, haunting and exactly what Game of Thrones does best, I expect Sandor to have his revenge, in more ways than one. Truth be told this wasn't the most exciting Thrones episode ever, but it returned to the terrific story-telling which has been seemingly absent of late."
356," The broken man - First character driven episode.
",10,True,"I must say this is second best episode of season 6 after ""The door"". The episode prologued with sweet surprise of Return of the hound. His changed character was reflected within no time and this shows success of adapting gravedigger stuff from books. This episode was totally character driven and shows conflict between moral thoughts about happiness between the hound and Ian macshane. The hound does not seem to be happy about definition of killing, rather at the end he decides to revenge and picks up his axe when his new family is butchered by brotherhood without banners. The episode name ""The broken man"" exactly suits with the current situation of hound, a man who tried to change himself unwillingly but ended up seeking for vengeance and his old definition of happiness.The other scenes of episodes were well filmed specially siege at Riverrun. The blackfish is played extraordinarily by the actor. His presence in screen makes a huge impact. I never felt such an arc of presence after Tywin Lannister on screen. The stabbing scene of Arya was just to shock people and I don't think she ll die anytime soon. The scenes of Jon snow & company approaching northern houses for aid were well filmed.+ve - The emotional turbulence of Hound, Siege of Riverrun Absence of Danny-Ve - No Tyrion in two episodes - he won't be there in 9th episode too. No Bran & visions.My rating 10/10"
357," Motives to Seek Revenge
",8,True,"The Hound was saved by Brother Ray, the leader of a community, and has a peaceful life working as woodman. When three men from the Brotherhood threaten the villagers, The Hound is worried about but Brother Ray does not believe in violence anymore. Margaery seems to be converted by the High-Sparrow, but when she learns that her grandmother Oleanna Tyrrell is in danger, she contacts her to convince Oleanna to leave King's Landing. Jon. Sansa and Davos are searching for allies to vanquish Ramsay and retake Winterfell. Jaime and Bronn arrive at the Blackfish Castle and Jaime tries to convince him to surrender to the siege to his castle. Theon and Yara are resting in a brothel and waiting for uncle Euron's attack. Arya makes arrangements to return to Westeros but she is stabbed by the Waif. ""The Broken Man"" is a great episode with attractive segments. In common, the characters have motives and will certainly seek revenge. The hound is alive after fighting Brienne. Margaerys is posing of woman of faith but she actually wants to defeat the High Sparrow. Yara's intention of joining Daenerys is a promising alliance. Will Arya survive from the attack if the Waif? My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""The Broken Man"""
358," An excellent episode that translates from the series is: a clash of power.
",9,True,"Bryan Cogman brings us once again a great driving the narrative in an episode that takes on all plots. In King's Landing Margaery throwing aside any doubt that the viewer had about their intentions (showing that yes, she never forgot the motto of your home and the lessons about politics that his grandmother gave him). In the North, the series shows how much has been accelerating the time to show Jon and Sansa three fairly distant locations in a beautiful sequence of scenes (with great emphasis on Lyanna Mormont). In the Riverlands, especially photography and beautiful CGI Riverrun. Arya coming up with an outfit and hairstyle that she never used only demonstrate that there is much more in your frame of what we are seeing. And of course the icing on the cake: Sandor, welcome! With a beautiful photo and outstanding performance of Ian McShane, the series makes clear that Clegane still have a big role to play (which is even more evident when, for the fourth time in more than 50 episodes, the series puts a scene before the opening). Too bad most of the fandom of the series is only interested in dragons and swords, and calls for a focused filler episode in game dialogues and character development."
359," The Pieces of the Puzzle Unite!
",9,True,"A fine episode as the Hound reappear and we find that the best laid plans of the pacifist don't exactly work. The Hound has been living with a kind of quiet, hard working group who feel work makes you free. In the milieu of GOT, however, there are few contrived lessons. The good have little advantage over the bad and must fight like crazy to stay on their feet. We get to see where several characters are at as the battle awaits. Sansa is with John, trying to raise and army to confront the Boltons. Arya has turned away from the face changers and begins to seek out a plan (but, then, who are her friends?). She is attacked by them. Theon is with his sister, who challenges his manhood, and we can see him acquiesce. Jaime Lannister is now leading forces for Cersei and must confront a stubborn man who has been harmed irreparably in the past and isn't about to join forces with a family he despises. Margery is now lying in the weeds. We know she is up to something. Her feckless little boy husband (what a little snot!) want her to spend more time with him. There is even more, but others have already addressed these things. I'll just say that this was one of the best episode."
360," Honestly, I'm quite surprised about this episode
",10,True,"As some of you may know, I have been quite harsh with my reviews. However, this episode I have actually found to be one of the best ones this season and I'll tell you why.The siege of Riverrun was really well done. I find D&D shine best when adapting book content and putting it into visuals, which is why this scene panned out so well. This scene pretty much exactly how I envisioned it while reading the books. The guy who plays the Black fish does an excellent job portraying him. The dialogue b/w the Blackfish and Jaime was really well done. Overall, a really good scene.The reintroduction of the hound was great, although not much of a surprise knowing about the gravedigger theory. I am quite curious to see where his arc is going. Many believe he is going to extract his vengeance on Gregor Clegane (his brother the Mountain), but this episode shows that it looks like he is going to get vengeance on the Brotherhood without Banners which is quite surprising.I also really liked Jon and Sansa going to gather northern support. My favourite parts in the book ADWD was when Stannis was trying to garner support from all of the Northern houses, and it was nice to see this pan out on screen although it was with Jon and Sansa.Also it was a huge relief that I didn't have to see Dany or Tyrion and all of Essos for an episode. I find that plot has been stagnating for quite some time and it was a relief that they ignored it this episode. Also, not having to see Ramsey with his plot armour for the past few episodes has been quite a relief as well.With all of the positives being stated, I do have some grievances. I don't really understand the point of them introducing Euron. Euron in the books is great but his show counterpart doesn't seem to really have a purpose. It seems like Dany will end up just taking the side of Asha/Yara and Theon, and stealing all of Euron's ships. Perhaps I'm speaking to soon, but it just seems like they will use him as a plot device to get Dany over to Westeros and nothing else and then Dany will backstab him. Or maybe he will serve some larger purpose in the show. I guess we'll see. While I don't really know if I think this is a 10, that's just how I write my reviews. If I like something, it gets a 10. If I don't like something, it gets a 1. Anyways, thanks for your time."
361," A great episode that isn't just setup for the final three
",10,True,"Right from the beginning of the episode, you could tell this was going to be a special one and oh boy, did it deliver! This season really is amazing (thus far)and this episode is probably the second best, right behind ""The Door"". It really tries new things and kind of breaks the fold when it comes to the structure of a Thrones episode as it really is focused on one character, who has returned after 2 years of being presumably dead, and his arc throughout the episode; trying to adjust to a life without murder, but then ultimately being sucked back into that world in a tragic ending. We get a surprise guest appearance from Ian McShane who, of course, gives a fantastic performance and really makes you care for his character in just mere minutes of screen time, making the unfortunate twist at the end of the episode all the more sadder. Of course, there are other surprises and plot advances, which only bolster the episode, but I'd just like to mention the Riverrun plot line, which featured a great scene between Jaime and the Blackfish, and the return of the beloved Bronn. It's great to see Jaime becoming the man Tywin wanted him to be and getting his family and their house back together ever since his daughter died in his arms back in Season 5, which has clearly changed him, for better or worse. Unfortunately, Tyrion is absent for a second episode in a row, which is fine because if there's no story to tell, then just checking up on him would purely be filler, but I always miss him and Varys's banter. The only flaw with this episode is what it doesn't have, but it doesn't really need it either. Therefore: I'm going to give this episode a 9.7/10."
362," A surprising return
",9,True,"In a pre-credit sequence it emerges that Sandor 'The Hound' Clegane is not dead; we learn that he was found by Brother Ray, a former soldier who has found the gods, and now lives in a peaceful community. A peace that isn't destined to last long. Further north Jon, Sansa and Ser Davos are trying to persuade the northern families that were loyal to the Starks to support them in their upcoming battle to retake Winterfell; they aren't as successful as they would hope. In King's Landing Queen Margaery cautions her mother to leave the city; suggesting that her conversion to the fanatical views of High Sparrow might not be as real as it first seemed. In Braavos Arya is planning to return to Winterfell but before she can leave she is attacked by The Waif. We also have the arrival of Jaime Lannister at the Siege of Riverrun.This was another fine episode which provided a couple of genuinely surprising moments as well as an unexpected laugh. The main surprise was the revelation that Sandor Clegane wasn't dead; it will be interesting to see what happens next for this character. The other surprise was the fight between Arya and The Waif; not that it took place but that Arya appeared to be seriously injured afterwards. The humour was provided in a delightful scene where Lyanna Mormont is petitioned to assist in the retaking of Winterfell when, after much debate, agrees and it is revealed that she has a force of sixty eight men! Young Bella Ramsey did a great job in the role of Lyanna. There isn't much in the way of action; much of what we see is clearly positioning for what is to come. Thankfully none of it was boring though it just served to make me keen to see what happens next."
363," Around the world in...oh, we're there already
",7,False,"In a mostly quiet episode, we get:the return of the Hound, with some foreshadowing of his (probable) future role (as well as a nice guest star in the shape of Ian McShane)Jaime arriving in Riverrun and facing Blackfish (with some more plausible foreshadowing)the revelation (not too surprising) that Margaery hasn't really become a faithful zealot, while her grandmother gives Cersei a talking to.Arya getting attacked by Waif - it was nice that she didn't suddenly develop the skill to win the fight, we'll see where this goes.And lastly, two story lines that while not problematic in their execution, do happen to invite some mockery. First we get Jon Snow and Sansa visiting the northern houses to gather support. Well. They go to Bear Island, Deepwood Motte, and the context implies a couple more places. Gathering precious few troops. Now, it's true, the little girl playing Lyanna Mormont does steal the show, and the scene with the Glovers was also good. Buuuuuuuut....if you happen to take a look at the map, you'll note it should have taken them quite some time to go around all these places - even if it was implied time (like, months) did pass, they wasted it all visiting lesser houses, instead of going directly to Lord Manderly, the guy who actually has the means to help. Pretty much the same happens in the very short segment with the ironborn. Sam hasn't managed to reach Oldtown after what, a year? But Theon and Yara have sailed across the entire world in about two days.And yeah, it's a passable sort of error, except. Except they introduced Euron 2-3 seasons late. If they hadn't, the timelines would actually work out."
364," Tasting as ""Game of Thrones"" again
",7,False,"It's because of the quality standards of this kind of episodes, ""Game of Thrones"" deserves to be criticized when somehow it deviates itself to a Hollywoodesque pretension of becoming a money apparatus for the audiences. Because it indeed damages its quality when this nonsense gets stuck in the heads of the economic maestros. Not only is unnecessary but also detrimental.This season has been generally like that with its ups and downs being the best of it plainly average because it gets banal when compared with other existent series made to be watched and thrown in the recycle bin.But this episode stroke me with a exhalation of hope. Truly... (or is it just me hungering for old GOT's primordial quality?) It proved me that the artistic sense of representation, an excellent script, the great dramatizations of great actors leaded by great directors orchestrating great ""musicians"" surpasses by far the hysteric need of special effects or everything having to be ""BIG"". Of course special effects are welcome, but they shouldn't be at the top of the pyramid of priorities. They are extras.Anyway, trash with that big. Big were the majestic dramatizations of Liam Cunningham (Ser Davos), Clive Russell (Brynden 'Blackfish' Tully), Diana Rigg (Olenna Tyrell) and most specially, the incredible Bella Ramsey (Lyanna Mormont). With honourable mentions to Natalie Dormer (Margaery Tyrell), Rory McCann, Ian McShane (Brother Ray) and Tim McInnerny (Robett Glover).And also BIG were the photography, the wardrobe, the landscapes, the characters developments, this episode."
365," The Broken Man delivers a very satisfying character-driven story for the season
",10,True,"The Broken Man is another classic episode for the sixth season and improves upon the previous episode (which I thought was great despite it's uneven pacing).It's easy to point out that the Hound, one of the characters who captured Arya Stark after her father was executed by King Joffrey, actually survived from his wounds after end of the fourth season and he gets some character development here. He's trying to find redemption by living peacefully with the villagers only to seek vengeance after finding his happiness taken away from him. Rory McCann, who played the Hound, also known as Sandor Clegane in the first four seasons, gives a really solid performance. Ian McShane, who plays Ray, the man who nursed him back to health, is a great addition to the show's sixth season and gives a superb performance as a peaceful man who helps the Hound find his happiness.That being said, everything else is great. Some of the story lines from the previous episodes have been advanced with Arya trying to get back home after she stopped Lady Crane from drinking her poisoned rum and decided not to become a faceless person, unaware that something terrible would happen to her. The performances are still solid, the pacing is very brisk, Mark Mylod, who directed the third and fourth episodes of Season 5, does a great job directing, the editing is really smooth, the scenery, sets, and costumes are still lavish, and Ramin Djawadi continues to deliver some perfect moments in his score.So, overall, The Broken Man succeeds in it's character-driven story for the Hound for the sixth season and sets up nicely to what's going to happen in the last three episodes. Thumbs up. :)"
366," All the pieces are being arranged nicely
",9,True,"This was one of my favorite episodes this season. I have been anxiously awaiting the return of The Hound, and I was very pleased to see Bronn again. I am VERY satisfied with where his (The Hound) arc has taken him so far, and I hope they show his act of retribution. I do hope that he eventually hooks up with Arya, and they rain blood on the realm. Cersei last, please. I liked Lady Tyrell's parting words to her.I do not know how Arya is going to survive a gut-wound like that, but she has to live. There was a quick glimpse of the next episode, and a fight with the Waif, so I'm guessing she'll find some Quik- Clot or something. I am curious how she is going to settle up with the assassin's guild. She can't evade them forever, even in the West.I am not thrilled with Sansa (now, or ever), and her campaign for war. She is not going to DO anything in battle, so it feels out of her place to see her champing at the bit to send men off to die in her name. It was great to hear her told 'no', and I thought the Mormont exchange was brilliant.Finally, Yara is my new favorite. And Theon needs to suck it up. Just because he can't partake doesn't mean his rain cloud needs to sour the mood of the crew. Get drunk, play tiddly-winks, or whatever. Do ANYTHING but ... cock-block. ... Too soon?All in all, I thought it was a great episode. Not a lot of action, per se, but a lot of moving of major parts for the battle royales to comes.Ha ha ha! 62 spears ... Bloody marvelous!"
367," Game of Thrones S06E07
",8,True,"I'm going to start by saying that I thought my episode was playing up the begin with. No opening credits had me really confused. But it was for the better. Because we got the god damn Hound back! Since Arya 'killed' him, I always thought he would return. In this day and age of TV and movies, no one is truly dead unless you see a body and a funeral.From then on the episode continued to role on strong. While this wasn't a big bang episode where everything happens and a million people die, it was an amazing Game of Thrones episode. What makes me really enjoy a series is when an episode can take a back seat and just lets the plot play out without anything major happening. For most people, they are called filler episodes, and to a point they are. But it's when these filler episodes are executed so fantastically and build up the story for the final few episodes that it really makes me love the show. I really loved everything with Jon and Sansa this episode. I thought the chemistry in negotiation with Jon, Sansa and Davos was so strong and at that point they probably could convince me to do anything. I thought the little girl was fantastic.I know we are starting to get to the back end of the series but I really hope she's a character we get to see more of in the next couple of years.All the scenes at Kings Landing were great as well. This is really the first time we get to see the High Sparrow have control over the city. With him controlling Tommen and Margery, he becomes one of the most powerful characters in the show. What I really liked about these scenes is how they show that the High Sparrow wants the bigger fish. He tries to use Margery to get her grandmother on board with the High Sparrows plans. Over this season I've really loved the High Sparrow. He is the same sort of character we have Little Finger where he is a manipulator and gets his power through other people.Something I thought was really smart this episode was the contrast between Arya and the Hound. As the Hound reappears, alive and healthy, we get to see what the Faceless Assassin has for Arya. As soon as I saw the old lady I knew something was going to happen, and when she first started getting stabbed, I thought it was going to be the end of Arya. I don't think she will die on the bases that her story only really features her, and to kill her would to completely remove that story. While the Red Wedding in many ways ended the storyline had by Rob and Catylin, it produced flow on effects that we are still seeing today.Overall a really great episode. I really like how they are building to the end of the season and with 3 episodes left, I think we are in for a big one."
368," This man may be broken, but the episode's quality isn't
",9,True,"Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.""The Broken Man"" may not quite be one of the best 'Game of Thrones' episodes. As far as Season 6 episodes go, it's not quite up there with ""Home"", ""Book of the Stranger"" and ""The Door"". That is in no way a knock because it is still a great episode that has almost everything that makes 'Game of Thrones' such a favourite. It doesn't matter that ""The Broken Man"" is not the most action-packed episode, that there aren't the big moments quite on the same level as other episodes and that it doesn't have as many bold revelations. What ""The Broken Man"" does brilliantly is the characterisation and development. One of the best episodes of Season 6 in this regard, plentiful and very rich, never less than interesting. It is one of those setting up episodes and putting things into place, again doing a great job with that and in a way that forwards momentum and like things are leading somewhere. It also does better than the previous Season 6 episodes for me actually in feeling the most like the first two seasons and like the show had gone back to its roots, possibly too the best Season 6 in general got in achieving this. No knocking here, just really liked that there was a return to this story approach. Did feel that Arya's scenes were a little rushed and didn't fit as comfortably as the rest of the more relevant and bigger events did, her biggest moment (her attack) is shocking though. Other than that, there are standout elements in the story and characters. In particular Sandor's return, the introduction of Lyanna, Blackfish (an awesome character), Jaime and Blackfish's interaction and the Riverrun siege. Have no issue with the performances with not a bad performance in the bunch, with the introductory and returning characters making just as much an impression as the regulars. Rory McCann is pretty scintillating, as is Clive Russell with some of the episode's best lines.Visually, ""The Broken Man"" looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about ""The Broken Man"" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film. The end scoring is especially powerful. Plenty of layers, passion and sensitivity in the writing, loved that for Blackfish.In summary, great episode. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
369," Time to gather allies!
",9,True,"I really like this episode, planning for this, planning for that. the main plot here is gathering allies. to the final fight for the Throne. there are a lots of fight that is about to happen. Attack at Winterfell, Siege of Riverrun, The High Sparrow and Daenerys taking the throne. IT IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN !!!"
370," A lot going for it
",7,False,"THE BROKEN MAN is obviously going to be a favourable THRONES episode for me, featuring as it does the return of the Hound - my all-time favourite character from the show. His scenes are handled with sensitivity and depth, featuring a great one-episode guest turn from no less than Ian McShane, although I wanted more. Do we really need to spend all that time with Yara and Theon in the brothel? It smacks of excess. Elsewhere, Arya's storyline moves on suddenly but has taken so long in earlier drawn-out scenes that it feels rushed now; the introduction of fan-favourite Lyanna is excellent, and the scenes involving the siege at Riverrun offer a bit of the military stuff we haven't seen for a while."
371," Some people never die
",9,True,"Some episodes need to be created to give the story a new twist in order to move the story forward. Some episodes have to be made to talk about some people who have even pulled themselves out of death. Some episodes have to be made to convey some important things. As if no friend is with us in times of need, and those whom we used to keep away from as enemies became close to us. Some episodes have to be made to teach people something, to teach them something. Some episodes have to be made so that some stories can be collected to make the next episode better. So don't think badly about it, never think that this episode of this season was very necessary. So watch Game of Thrones."
372," Ouch
",10,True,Great episode. Lots of action and adventure and a great story
373," Necessary steps towards the finale
",8,True,"The highlight of this episode is the introduction of 10 year old bad-ass Lyanna Mormont. Brilliant! Other than that, it's a good, but not a great episode."
374," Best episode in the season so far
",9,True,"This episode made me realise certain things.I don't really care about Daenerys, I can't make myself to identify with her, she can't be harmed by fire, has dragons as pets, leader of a massive army, and she's hot, way to go writing the most boring character in the series, no wait that's Sam.Speaking of which I don't miss Sam and Gilly at all, I hope they'll choke on some evil medieval? artichoke or something, thanks bye!I miss Tyrion! Was he sleeping? Drinking? I must know!A good episode does not have to hold a scene of a battle, just some really good writing and acting will do fine, unless they can repeat the quality of Hardhome.Obligatory death scenes. Getting really annoying though, this episode it was Ian McShane, maybe JRR himself should make a death scene cameo, many people would be pleased.Some characters are too good to complain that people in GoT are coming back too frequently after they die. Bold but clever.Castle sieges! Finally we're talking medieval. But this particular was uneventful. As much as I dislike deus ex machina a dragon would fit nicely into a castle siege. Here's hoping.Not all child leaders are idiots or otherwise cringe-worthy.I wish I could've expressed myself more eloquently, but all I really wanted to say is that it is the characters, the lore, the ""daily stuff"", the not so simple stories of the simple folk that make the story come alive. We've witnessed a story of a small group of people who tried to live peacefully out of harm's way, but they failed, because that was the lesson, it is pointless to search for a healthy spot on a diseased body.This was a great episode because it brought me back to the main plot of the story, back to the real, away from the banal desire to see who will sit on the rusty throne, but to raise a question ""How the hell can anyone live in this place?"""
375," What were they thinking?
",2,False,"I can honestly not fathom how the writers wrote down the ending for Arya's storyline in Braavos, read it through a few times, perhaps asked a few other people for their opinion and put it into action without thinking ""this is ridiculous, contrived, Hollywood nonsense"".The rest of the episode is mostly fine. King's Landing was enjoyable, for once something actually happens in Mereen and the Riverrun siege...well, I suppose I don't understand how the Blackfish can get all teary-eyed over Sansa being just like Cat but refuses to go with Brienne because he wants to hold his home, yet when his home is lost he STILL refuses to go with her just to die off-screen for no reason. Never mind that, though. This is way worse.So at the end of last episode, Arya acts entirely out of character by wearing fancy clothes, tossing around money, strolling around like a fancy lady, all while being unarmed while being hunted by the faceless men, which she must've been aware of given her, you know, spending two and a half seasons with them and acting all prepared for an attack at the end of S06E06. Predictably, she gets stabbed by the waif but manages to survive and get away.Since Arya acted so tremendously out of character, we were led to believe that either she had prepared some sort of trap or perhaps this wasn't even Arya at all. Or at least that she had some sort of basic plan. NOPE! As if she had not at all considered the possibility that she may be attacked by the assassins who she betrayed a few days ago, she goes off to Lady Crane who magically heals her wound. ""Never mind getting stabbed in the gut, I'll just sleep it off!"" The waif tracks her down, kills Lady Crane and after some Terminator-esque monologue from the waif, she chases Arya, who has regained all her strength after being stabbed all of a sudden, even though she could barely walk after she got out of bed, through half the city. Stuff happens, Arya leads her to her hideout and kills her in the dark and off-screen. She returns to Jaqen, confronts him and then leaves.The thing is, had Arya knowingly lead her to her hideout in order to fight her in the dark, that would make some sense. She knew she would be attacked, so she baited the waif (with the fairly risky tactic of getting herself stabbed) and lured her to her safehouse. But no. Arya has no idea what's going on. It's absolutely absurd and completely out of character. There's no way Arya would not know she was being hunted. There's no way she would be unarmed and strutting around like she owns the place, unless there was some plan behind it all. There wasn't. It was just awful writing.In my opinion, this is the lowest point of the series. To see such a long, drawn out storyline of a major character end like some awful cliché Hollywood action movie is just baffling."
376," Worst episode of the series
",5,False,"The northern battle is so hyped up for next episode, but there was absolutely no set up for it in this episode. So far we have Jon and Sansa's army of wildlings, their small donations of 62 good men and littlefinger who will ride in an save the day - (I think we could all guess this by now) If he doesn't Sansa and Jon will just fail dismally. I'm assuming the next episode will get straight into the battle and/or give no setup.OK understandably there was no light in the room, but the Waif vs Arya would be such an emotional battle. Both girls hate each other and I would've liked to see their struggle against each other. Instead we're left with a ""I killed her, and by the way I don't care about your faceless men anymore"" and Jaqen was like ""Good work girl"" Logic/10 right there.The same can be said for the Blackfish - ""I'm gonna die fighting"" attitude was admirable, but the next scene is some random soldier telling Jaime ""Yo, he's dead"" - A Barristan Selmy style death would've been appropriate here, but obviously the producers thought that it would've been too much effort, funny, I get that feeling about a lot of this season's content.I'm not even gonna start on the Lemoncloak, actually I am, Fans: ""Yes, we might get Lady Stoneheart"" or ""Nice maybe his character might do more in the shows than he does in the books."" Instead we got an episode 7 ""OMG LEMONCLOAK"" - Episode 8 ""He's dead now but he has nice boots"" I must've blinked and missed it, what was the point of his character?The siege of Meereen was comprised of a) a clip of the ships coming, in b) The ships firing and c) The city on fire. The rest of it was ""We can't defend the city, lets hide in the pyramid, oh hi Dany, good of you to show up for 5 seconds"" My question is ""Why don't they just move trebuchets to fire at the pyramid once they take the city with minimal effort. This siege is really underwhelming.Tommen just singlehandedly ruined all Cleganebowl hype and crushed fans. From the fans point of view I think we all want/know Tommen will die. How Tommen doesn't realize he's being used is amazing. No kid could be dumber and Kevan just lets this happen?All in all, I can see why the producers are saying they don't have enough content left, they can't deflect fan's disappointment when it's obvious that this season was rushed.There are massive holes in story lines/storyline deaths in general. A few examples being Dorne and Lady Stoneheart, and some scenes have just been skipped over, examples would be the siege or Meereen and fight scenes/deaths mentioned above.This episode was meant to set the scene for the upcoming battle next episode + the King's Landing trials + maybe some Bran/Benjen update. It didn't accomplish the first and mutilated the second. I felt that the hound using his axe was the only part of this episode that wasn't a waste of time. The title ""No-one"" Clearly pointed to Arya, but even her parkour + skipped fight scene + talk with Jaqen that doesn't make sense, she basically told him where to shove his death cult and he doesn't care. Now the only way that they can get around this logic loophole is if Jaqen = Syrio. While that theory is plausible I don't see how they plan to introduce it now Arya is going home. I'm trying to envision a scene where Jaqen is waving to Arya as she gets on a boat - ""Farewell Arya, oh I forgot to mention, I'm Syrio"" (Massive reveal, LOL NO)This episode was so disappointing and so has this season in general. The only good scenes so far are:Lyanna Mormont Hodor's death Tower of Joy Jon and Sansa reunion Jaime vs Blackfish conversation I'd like to say Benjen, but that was too predictableMy advice as a fan would be to get the director of that play that Lady Crane acts in and use him to direct the next season, because this season has been terrible considering this is Game of Thrones."
377," Get me some of that Lady Crane soup!
",1,False,"Game of Thrones is going down the drain. Admit it people. Weis and Benioff are taking A Song of Ice & Fire and literally butchering it. The testament to this fact? I was laughing out loud throughout every Arya Stark scene in this episode. I mean what the hell?? She is thoroughly gutted (your gut has the most concentrated blood flow in all of your body) - yet she still manages to swim through a canal and walk don't know how many steps to find Lady Crane's theater troupe.There the writers have us believe that somehow all is alright with a few bandages from a woman who knows ""how to cut"", some bad soup, and a little of the good old milk of poppy.The next thing we see is that this frail girl who has lost a lot of blood is doing Parkour through the streets of Braavos while evading the chasing Waif. Haha.If that was not enough, Arya manages to lure the Waif into an actual trap where she grabs her trusty old Needle. Blowing out the lone candle in the room and subsequently using her amazing power of hearing, she slaughters the Waif, cuts her face off with surgical precision, infiltrates the Temple and puts up a display for Jaqen H'ghar.There she utters some lines that were supposed to make us forget all this bull feces that unfolded earlier. But no, we will not forget.I mean, all I can say is that I want some of that magical Lady Crane soup!"
378," Probably the worst GoT episode ever
",4,False,"The worst episode of season 6, maybe of the entire Game of Thrones series. Note: this review will contain spoilers.– The scenes with Arya were VERY disappointing and it's the main reason why I give this episode such a low rating. It seemed as if the writers did not bother too much with ending Arya's business with The Faceless Men, which is just too bad for I actually enjoyed it until now. All that stabbing and all the she needs is a bit of milk of poppy, some soup and sleep. When she wakes up, she can jump from a first floor window, run from the waif and then put up a terrible fight even if she were wounded. I understand very well the importance of the suspension of disbelief, but it was way too much for me to accept it. I can accept dragons and magic, if those are rules (I love fantasy), but don't bend the rules only because you don't want to waste too much time with finding a decent resolution. And that ending with Jaqen? Anti- climatic to say the least Arya cuts the waif's face, makes her way into the House of Black and White and Jaqen doesn't find out until the waif's face is displayed? Very unlikely. Then she threatens him and all he can say is ""a girl is truly no one"". For God's sake, why? For killing the waif and bringing him her face? It doesn't make much sense, especially since he knew very well that Arya was never no one. I am VERY disappointed with all of this. The GoT writers have utterly failed the Braavos line and it is quite a shame, really.– The surrender of Riverrun wasn't too great either. I understand what Edmure is doing and why, but I had hoped to see more of the Blackwish (Brynden Tully). However, D&D were unwilling to do more about it. If this is the end of the legendary Blackfish, a man of great courage and cunning, one of the great mind military minds of Westeros, a fighter who survived the massacre at the infamous Red Wedding, then it's another fail on part of the show's writers. I would like to point out that in the books Brynden Tully SURVIVES the siege of Riverrun.-+ Brienne of Tarth and the Blackfish: an interesting exchange between two strong characters. That being said, I doubt it that B. Tully would be so selfish and militarily stupid as to ignore Sansa's plead for help. A castle is worth nothing if you lose your family, especially to the savage Boltons. That is why I found all this ending to Riverrun a bit unrealistic. Fine, fight the Lannister and Freys, but when everything is lost, why not help your family? Silly stuff, really. I can't believe they've pulled something like this.I've even read part of an interview with director Mark Mylod and he was defending all this stuff with Arya and the Blackfish. Sorry, I loved ""The Broken Man"", ""The Sons of Harpy"" and ""The High Sparrow"", but this ""No one"" episode was really bad. -+ Brienne of Tarth and Jaime Lannister had a few scenes together. Brienne did her best to convince Jamie to let her negotiate with the Blackfish for a truce and he agreed. It didn't work out that way, but the episode managed to underscore the Kingslayer's feelings for Brienne. She is his moral compass and it's just too bad that he can't find in himself the strength to do the right thing to the very end. Time will tell just how strong is her influence on him, but at the moment his allegiance to Cersei and his father's politics of House Lannister proved stronger. That being said, I don't think that I've liked too much the last scene, with Brienne leaving the castly by boat and Jamie watching from above. It felt a bit forced - we already know that they care for one another, there's no need for that. + Pod and Bronn: Bronn was funny as usual, trying to teach Pod a trick or two about real fighting and, of course, some bad jokes.+ Jaime and Edmure: Their exchange was quite telling of Jamie's resoluteness to end the siege as soon as possible. I'm not sure Jamie is back to old Jamie, the one that could kill a child, but he managed to convince Edmure Tully that he must bow to his will. Both actors did their best to represent their characters and to me it was one of the most interesting scenes of the season.+ Beric Dondarrion and Thoros of Myr are just as we left them: still on the right side, still decent men, still interesting. Their meeting with The Hound was quite satisfying, even though I expected it to happen later on in season 6. Their talk about the threat of the White Walkers makes me optimistic about the future of the Brotherhood without Banners.+ Cersei and the Mountain: I choose violence + Tommen's betrayal => very good scenes. Lena Headey is truly a great actress: she has shown us all just how hurt Cersei was by Tommen's betrayal. That naive and foolish boy will probably bring doom upon the entire city. A hurt Cersei may actually succeed where the Mad King failed: burning King's Landing to the ground with wildfire."
379," Show writers need help from the book author
",1,False,"Show writers need to face the fact they fall back awkwardly on Hollywood clichés and if they want to keep this series as high quality as possible they need to take more dialog and plot from the books talented author...For example the big boring ridiculous chase scenes that made no sense at all such as Aria Starks, a character that used to be interesting (first she becomes unbelievably and uncharacteristically unaware of her surroundings and get stabbed and then somehow doesn't die and it only takes a good old bowl of soup to 'heal' her and seems more of a threat to oranges than a skilled trained assassin) and then Blackfish, the legend, who is brought back just to die like a stubborn old fart rather than have the wits to escape again as in the books. Show writers - Have some respect for your characters and what they are likely to do, or not do and if you can't figure it out then read the damn books to figure out what is in character and what is not and stop foisting tired Hollywood tropes."
380," WTF happened to arya storyline ??
",6,False,"Last week episode was great, character driven with superb dialogue and in all this near the end we get a few minutes of Arya's story . And it just didn't make any sense .She knows very well that since she failed her mission the faceless organization will send people after her , Jaqen even warns her there will not be a ""3rd time "" , so the character knows she is in mortal danger . Despite all this you see her casually roaming around the city booking passage on a ship and looking at sunsets without a worry.You would think that after all she has been through she would be more careful , paranoid , wary of everyone . And then the waif in disguise as a sweet old lady doesn't raise any suspicions from Arya even tho she saw that face last season in the hall. Even if this is all a ruse to catch the assassin that she knows they will send after her she wouldn't be so foolish as to let anyone get close enough that they would have a chance of killing her , she had a lot of training, she knows how they operate and this reason wouldn't work either . So with a slash across her belly and 2 stabs the last one even had a twist she manages to get away .Because of the above reasons Arya scene doesn't have any logic unless there is a twist to be revealed and we all had speculations and various theories to what might happen.It turns out this week it was exactly what we saw no twist no logical explanation for the characters behavior just awful shameful writing to get Arya from point A to point B . Even more so it appears she has just a flesh wound .And no she wouldn't have had time to heal it was a matter of hours when the waif found her again not weeks but hey screw logic , D&D need to get her to Westeros .The way Arya manages to defeat the waif by trapping her in a room pitch dark works fine , problem is everything leading to that are all the issues listed above .Anyways onto probably the last scene between Arya and Jaqen he says ""Finally a girl is no one"" why would he say that ? Isn't it obvious ? She refused to carry out the mission you gave her , she killed the assassin you sent after her, she is threatening you with Needle . This was worse then the Dorne plot.The rest of the episode was decent ,Dany comes home and finds out her children have been naughty , Jaime did well in the end , Cersei is screwed , and The Hound found a new pair of boots , my favorite scene this season so far."
381," Without GRRM D & D Roar but they are no Lions
",3,False,"I am only going to mention the Arya plot line, as I agree with the posters on the first page of this reviews section - Karl, Nathan, Delta, etc, that it was very poor.I have only seen the TV series, not read the books but I loved it. The grimness, unpredictability, characters dying, bad guys winning etc, made it hugely different to most other things on TV. I was begging the Red Viper not to do something flashy but kill the Mountain ""Pleeeasee, shut up, stab him some more"" We know how that ended up.Apart from the magic, the world is grimly realistic. Did you note how in this episode, as Varys and Tyrion were saying touching goodbyes, there were several beggars around, and Varys wafted past them as though they didn't exist...and he's one of the most sensitive and concerned people in the series. That's GoT world folks.On to the Arya stuff. We've all be led to believe that she is going to become some sort of pint-size super soldier - with the twin-track sword-training of Silvio Forel and her later assassin Masters in the House of B/W.So once the Waif (plus possibly others) is on her trail she's got to have a super-cunning plan.We've all seen a lot of films where the hero beats enemies by sheer wit and cunning. That's what we wanted. Like many of you, when she was arrogantly strutting around, flashing cash (and not wearing Needle - eh?) it seemed like a big setup. Or as some theories said Jaquen impersonating Arya. So walking into an ambush where a crone turns into the Waifinator and getting gut-stabbed...is that a plan?No,in Medieval times its death. Pre-antibiotics peritonitis is fatal. I read somewhere that 25% of medieval warfare casualties died of this agonisingly after the battle and there was no cure. A Viking re- enactor friend of mine said ""Onion Soup"" when I asked him about this. ""Eh?"" I said. He explained that if someone had a gut wound, he would be given onion soup and then they would smell his wound - if it smelled of onions, he would be given a priest, if it did not they would sew him up and hope he would survive.It's totally unbelievable that Arya could survive multiple stabbings and falling into disease-ridden water, then do a full Braavos Parkour.Let's look at that E7 sequence again:Arya goes around approaching the Westeros sailors. She has needle. When the crone approaches, Arya isn't fooled and draws her sword and there is a fight and both the waif and Arya are cut but not seriously, then she dives off the bridge and escapes. That's more believable and sets up that A is not the Waif's victim any more.I can think of various other ways of Arya beating the waif, for example if she was injured when the Waif kills Lady Crane, but had Needle, then pretends to be in a drugged sleep and just stabs her though the heart then that would reveal that she has become a deadly assassin. Or we see the mammoth fight which we were cheated out of. While they wasted time with an irrelevant jokes scene. Quite frankly someone with a small dagger v basket hilted rapier is probably not ever going to win.....That's why I found it all so stupid, and insulting to my intelligence.The plotting of this was basically pants. The two Ds really need GRRM imo."
382," Incredible
",3,False,"It's unbelievable how ugly and boring and poorly written this show has become. We are now not above the level of some trivial ""fantasy"" show from the 80's or the 90's, like Xena or Hercules. No better than that. The entire Arya's story arc in Braavos appears now silly and pointless. To be honest, all that gigantic House of Black and White now appears to be silly and pointless. Arya's survival and fast recovery from multiple stabbing, twisting of the knife, diving and swimming is beyond any likelihood. The chase in the Braavos' streets was lame, uninteresting, completely out of character for a faceless woman, and poorly written (action packed b-movie at best). Completely lacking the swift elegance we were used to associate to faceless men style. Let alone the waif turned into a female parody of dear old Schwarzy Terminator. And then Jaqen who congratulate Arya ""well done, little girl, you just killed my trusted assistant, now you are No One"" like it were basically a duel. The dumbest guild of assassins ever. One could list ton of things that are definitely unconvincing: for all, I would mention the ""send a raven to Sansa"" line, but Sansa ... where exactly? Which castle? Isn't she rallying through the North? Isn't she homeless at present? Maybe a cell raven? Also the Meereenese story is not working at all. The sudden return of Dany was, in particular, cliché (let alone the dull conversations between Tyrion and the others). Riverrun siege was rushed (Blackfish dying offscreen definitely lazy). The return of the Hound and the Brotherhood without Banners still remains without serious reasons (we hope to have some reasons in the forthcoming episodes, but you may have some doubts). At this point, in retrospect, the entire season 6 appears more and more as a disaster in its writing and its global structure, from Jon's resurrection (has someone caught some consequence of such resurrection? Has someone guessed what's the use and the sense of Jon's death and comeback?) I wouldn't have believed, back at the end of season 4, that this show would have reached this low level in a couple of season. Hard to explain."
383," By Far Worst Episode in the Series **spoilers**
",2,False,"This episode of GoT was so bad it prompted me to write my first review ever.The two off screen kills were just pathetic. Everyone has mentioned other criticisms which I mostly agree, but there's one thing that hasn't been mentioned that severely annoyed me off about the episode, the siege at Meereen. For the past 6 years we've been waiting for a truly great scene of one of the dragons to unleash hell. The city is been pounded with catapults, there seems to be no way out and then we hear a thud on the pyramid.I thought 'Great! Daenerys is going to fly Drogo and reign fire on the WOODEN ships all nicely packed together in one fell swoop. Perhaps this season will redeem its self a little.'But no, Daenerys just hops off and the dragon flies away... It was at this point I started cursing and needed to walk away.I've never been so irritated after a GoT episode."
384," Worst Episode of the Series
",5,False,"While many reviews I see on IMDb talk about the show being inconsistent (""I liked this episode much more than the last 4! Show was getting boring"") I generally love almost every episode. I enjoy slower scenes as long as they further character arcs and their plots against each other, which they almost always do. This is one of the 3 or 4 episodes I would rate below an 8/10. And since this is the very worst episode of the series I think a 5 is justified. ""No One"" focuses heavily on the culmination of Arya's Braavos adventure, the worst plot line of the entire series besides the horribly implemented Sand Snake garbage. I enjoy the city and culture of Braavos, but 80% of the time we have been stuck in the Faceless god's shoddy cathedral, and for these last two seasons it has been apparent that none of these events are going to have any impact on the metaplot. None of these characters are going to come with Arya back to Westeros, unlike with Danyeris where at times the plot seems completely separate from Starks/Kings Landing/The North, at least you know with Dany she is going to cross and bring many of her plot threads with her. These two seasons of Arya have basically just been about building her character up into a more ruthless killer, but all you have to do is go back to season 4 and see that she is quite a capable killer already on the road with the Hound. Her character doesn't develop emotionally, she resolutely is still the same vengeance driven victim she was from season 2 on. So basically I am saying Arya's two seasons in Braavos are filler, and this poorly directed, convenience driven action finale does nothing to redeem the arc.Edmure Tully has been characterized as a incompetent weakling but no precedent has been made that his character would willingly betray his families honor and sacrifice his Uncles life for the life of a baby that he has never seen and was conceived though an enemy trap. The siege on Riverrun is never shown, we get one shot of the Blackfish unsheathing his sword in a stairwell, and he is killed off screen. Arya's final duel with the Nameless Girl occurs, OFFSCREEN! We have to suffer through another ""Tyrion doesn't know how to relate to his former- slave advisors!"" filler scene. One was enough. The fact that we haven't seen Tyrion in 2 episodes, and then this one has two quick scenes (one being filler) before the city is being sieged just emphasizes how little material they had for Tyrion this season.I like Tyrions line about being the ""Most famous Dwarf in the World,"" I like that Jaime gets to embrace his dark side which we haven't seen since season 2. I also enjoyed Pof and Bronn's reunion. The scenes of Cersei being further diminished are adequate. And also there has been a pattern set for the 8th episode being monumental (Hard Home, Viper v Mt), this one was a huge letdown."
385," Why I don't listen to theories
",10,True,"I really enjoyed this episode and disagree with the hate against it. I thought it was (as usual) well written, performed,... While I do sort of see how people think this episode made Arya's story pointless, I don't fully agree. I think most people are mad because they heard the theories and expected something more, an example of how overthinking things can ruin those things sometimes. Arya fought the Waif in the dark because she had experience with not seeing, it's simple and feels good when you see her head in the hall of faces. And when it comes to the Blackfish stuff I think that's mainly a book thing that made people mad. Which I can understand but remember that this is its own show. Enjoy the books and enjoy the show but keep in mind they're both doing their own thing. So I think this was a good episode apart from, admittedly, the Arya stuff being a bit of an anticlimax. But I loved the Tyrion scenes, the Jaime scenes, the King's Landing scenes, the Hound scenes, all in all another solid Game of Thrones episode"
386," You can do better than that.
",4,False,"OK first review for GoT. I haven't read the books so this review is purely based on the TV adaptation.The Hound. His return last episode was good but his redemption arc was poor. I don't understand why they had to fit him trying to change his life, with the death of the preacher in one episode. They should have gradually shown him throughout the season learning this new life and it then be torn apart like that towards the end of season, it happened too quick and felt rushed, his story suffers as a result. His conversation with his victims was cringe worthy ""f*ck you"" ""you can do better than that"" ""urm.. C*nt!"" ""You are really sh*t at dying"". I mean this summed up the episode for me, earlier episodes had real depth in their dialogue.. This is just slapstick child's play. 5/10Riverrun. A siege is avoided through Jamie's blackmail and the blackfish story is over. Anti-climax, I hate to be repetitive with the other reviewers but I have to agree. The Tully words are ""family, duty, honour"" in that order (something which Catelyn died for) yet he abandons Sansa to die in a place he does not even rule. Pointless end to a promising character. Brienne and Jamie were good in this episode and Bronns exchange with Pod was funny I thought, fits with his character. 5/10Kings Landing. The best story this series for me. I think the High Sparrow is the smartest villain on the show. He knows how to play the game and could give little finger and Varys a run for their money. As Olenna pointed out last episode, Cersei is done. She has no allies and the situation is her own doing by arming the Faith to get back at the Tyrell's by having them imprisoned. The High Sparrow has got her cornered and I think I know what Qyburn's discovery entails for the city. The clue is in the name. I always have said, the Lannisters were done with the departure of Tyrion and death of Tywin. I enjoy the politics of power here and this has played out beautifully and is well paced. The theory of the hound facing the mountain has been squashed though which I thought would have been a great scene for the series. 8/10Mereen. So much promise here with the governing skills of Tyrion but we are left disappointed. There has been only 2 noteworthy appearances from Tyrion this season: unleashing the dragons and making a pact with the masters. Both were smart moves. Now the conversation with grey worm and missandei was another cringe fest and dragged on for far too long. Peter Dinklage deserves better lines than this, he has so much more to offer but again we are left shortchanged. Dany's trademark appearance with dragons got old a long time ago. Her story has been very stale this season and does not change in this episode. We all expect the dragons to burn the ships, the city to worship her again and for the season to end with her sailing to Westeros. The lack of material really shows with her story. 3/10.Arya. The main story of the episode. I was not expecting much after seeing her stabbed and slashed yet ninja flip into the water and escape the Waif last episode. The waif is a trained assassin, Arya would not get away from that in the first place and just undermines the skill of the faceless training. So she hides backstage in the play and is healed by some soup. She is chased by the waif through the city and she jumps off a building, falls down a thousand steps, splits her stomach open again yet defeats the waif in the dark. To top it off, she travels all the way back to the house of black and white, heals up, sneaks past the master assassin jaqen and puts a face on the wall. Jaqen tells her she is no one even though she is holding needle, a token of her identity, seemingly because she has a sword to his heart and pretends it was his plan all along. Clearly the writers had no idea how to end this story and thought this would be the most entertaining way. They were horribly wrong, the whole sequence is littered with plot holes and seriously discredits the series. 1/10Overall 4/10. Aryas story aside, the episode was nearly satisfactory but the level of inconsistency in the Arya story alone makes this a poor episode overall."
387," An interesting episode with some ups and downs.
",8,True,"This episode I especially liked the Kingslayer. How he manipulated lord Edmure to give the castle away. (the Kingslayer showed some really strong characteristics from his dad this episode) Also the performance from the Blackfish was very interesting to see. To bad that he supposedly died off-screen. I would think a character like the Blackfish would get a way bigger exit than he was given. Unless the writers have something more in-store with him, I really hope so. I also liked how Cercei stood up against the Faith, however this in turn led to her own son, the King being manipulated by the Faith in removing trial by combat. With other words Cercei showed her power to early leading to the faith realizing trial by combat is Cercei's trump card, thus removing it. On the other hand, what I didn't like in this episode was how the writers went along with Arya's story-line. I was hoping that Arya being stabbed was somehow part of the house of Black and Whites trial program. I did like how Arya finally realizes that she doesn't want to be no one. There was way more going on this episode, we finally see Tyrion again after two episodes, the scene where he is making fun with Missandei and Grey Worm was a delight to watch! I think the writers also made some mistakes with Daenerys this season. Up to the point where she lights the temple on fire with all the Khal's inside, that was magnificent. After that it went down hill fast with her. They are trying way to much with Daenerys, we don't need Daenerys doing something great every episode, tone it down a bit, please! + Jamie Lannister starting to sound like his dad, whilst keeping some of his more gentler sides. (letting Brienne go) + The Hound seeking justice + The mountain being an immovable object + The Faith realizing this and thus rendering the Mountain obsolete + Tyrion realizing things go a bit different in this part of the world. The Blackfish dying off-screen (or did he?) -Arya story-line way too rigid - Daenerys doing something great every episodeOverall, very cool episode. I would rate it a 8,3."
388," Game of disappointment
",5,False,"Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.So it is paining me to actually a less than positive review to express my disappointment in ""No One"". This is not going to be a popular opinion, but for me ""No One"" was the first big disappointment of 'Game of Thrones'. Saying this because there are some controversial previous episodes and quite a few fans didn't like Season 5 in general. To me, the previous episodes ranged from good to special. Wouldn't say from personal opinion that ""No One"" is a terrible episode, but it is not a representation of what made me a fan of the show and do agree with many of the criticisms. Will start off with the good things. Visually, ""No One"" looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about ""No One"" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film. Have no qualms with the acting, which all round is spot on with no exceptions regardless of the character writing and such. Wonderful to see Peter Dinklage again and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau does give some of his best acting here. A few of the story and script elements are done well. Tyrion's scene with Missandrei and Grey Worm is a highlight, while of the storylines the King's Landing (Cersei is awesome here!) and the Brotherhood Without Banners re-introduction come off best. Love Bronn, a great job was done with Jaime and did enjoy him with Brienne. A few nice lines.However, there are also major drawbacks. Do have to agree that Arya's storyline brings down ""No One"" significantly. Anti-climactic, contrived and implausible with an out of character Arya (even when taking into account the defence the story has gotten), it was a mess. Was mixed on the Riverrun scenes. Love Jaime and there are some gritty, intense and emotional parts. The storyline just felt too rushed and resolved too easily. And sorry, Blackfish deserved much better treatment than he got here. For me, too much of ""No One"" felt on the rushed side and it all felt too tidy and pat. Other episodes do a far better job progressing the characters and subplots (Jaime comes closest here), some people may argue that this is one of those setting up and putting things into place episodes, but ""The Broken Man"" did that much better while still moving things forward. And please make Tommen and Edmure more interesting, there is not enough to them yet to pass as ""love to hate"" etc. characters yet.Overall, a disappointment while still being watchable. 5/10 Bethany Cox"
389," So much hype for nothing
",1,False,"Its not that the episode was especially bad but rather the whole hype that was build up around Arya, Riverunn, Mountain vs. Sparrows just disappeared in thin air.After training with the worlds best assassin i expected to see an awesome fight sequence between Arya and the Waif, more dramatic and maybe a game of hide and seek with changing different faces, but instead we got a cheap chase tr-ought the city and in the end no battle, yeah Arya won and is going back to Wasteros, then why the hell did she go to Bravos in the first place. Her story line feels like a big filler now.Really no fight, not even the Blackfish taking out couple of Lannisters, only a stupid way to surrounded the castle, I mean i have bigger issues with believing in this then believing in dragons.And Kings landing plot is just so stupid, i was expecting that Tommen and Cersie where plotting something together since the moment he asked her for help, instead he just sentences her to death by abolishing the trial by combat. There was no creativity in the writing, no ideas, no twisting plots we are used too, just straight forward movement from point A to point B.D&D should involve GRRM more, he might write a lot of unnecessary things but at least his plot developments tie you to the chair in anticipation of what to come, but not this garbage that was presented to us in ""No One"" I thing they lost the interest in doing the show!"
390," What a disappointment
",3,False,"All I ever had for Game of Thrones before was praise after praise after praise. It felt real, dark, felt like I was part of it all because people died, good and bad, things happen, good and bad. I hate stories where you're forced to choose sides ""the heroes"". And whatever happens those ""heroes"" cannot die making the entire thing stupid, predictable and not worth watching. Game of Thrones WAS different, I looked forward to next episode because I will wonder what will happen, who will die? Now I'm put of Game of Thrones and may not watch it ever again thanks to this episode. It has lost the unique feature which I liked only in Game of Thrones, turned to all other shows, ""the hero cannot die"".Let me explain why I think this. Arya, someone training to fight for a long time, knew a much better assassin was chasing after her. Motivated to kill her. Last episode she walks round the street, having a great time, as if she was safe and she got stabbed by the waif. You left all of us thinking, wow, an assassin trying to kill her, she is definitely bleeding to death, no doubt about it. It must be Jaqen disguising as her so that he is able to point out that the Waif is showing emotion and No-one cannot show hate. Or Arya had used some sort of a trick, it wasn't her blood, something she may have picked up.Nope! Screw you all! Arya is just fine, she managed to reach the set again while somehow he Waif could not see her. Are you serious? She could only hold her breath under water for that long and must have made splashes and the Waif couldn't find her?Then she has a lethal wound which would have killed anyone in Game of Thrones within 20 seconds. She has had training doesn't mean she is invincible to death. Somehow manages to get to Lady Craine while not bleeding to death. Then a little bandage and some milk of the poppy and she's fine. Her biggest complaint being she doesn't want the milk of the poppy. Hahaha what a joke. The Waif arrives, so conveniently, at the perfect time so Arya could be half asleep and she could make a loud bang, kill someone she didn't need to instead of just sneaking into Arya's room and slitting her throat. Or entering from the window. The Arya can run just fine, a lethal wound, who cares? The Waif doing some of the shittiest Hollywood running where she runs slow, trying to make it look tense but making it look horrifically awful. And Arya so predictably goes to the dark cave where her sword was. Now you can look and this and say, 'Oh she planned this all out.' Yep, for this plan to work the way it did, she has to know. 1. Where the Waif would attack her so she can mysteriously disappear into the water. 2. Waif wouldn't kill her there and then, because she is an assassin. And a much better one than Arya. 3. Lady Craine would heal her up, she had a conversation and said 'you're good at this' and then they conversed about how she was good at this and Lady Craine explained why she was good, showing she had no previous knowledge.4. She would conveniently wake up in time to not die.5. Run perfectly fine with a wound but also being helped by the fact that the Waif does the stupid walk trying to make it look 'tense'. 6. Get to her little cave. 7.Actually beat the Waif, the Waif might also have lost her eyes and worked much more for them. 8. Not bleed to death after she fell down the stairs and opened up her previous wound when the Waif chased her, which wasn't even shown or healed.What I found the most sad about this episode was that: Khal Drogo got slightly cut once and died of infection. Roose Bolton who got stabbed once died, within seconds. Arya Stark gets stabbed multiple times by an assassin and she is running the next day.Now that's not all I got, I was skeptical about the Blackfish dying for nothing, he could have escaped, helped Sansa, maybe get back his castle again, get revenge on the Lanisters. All for the reason that Brienne will ""protect Sansa"" better than he has.Tyrion is another topic, I'm sorry, but making Tyrion say things that we would in the modern world doesn't make you a good writer, and doesn't make you clever or witty like you think it does. It makes you the exact opposite. I'm sorry but a few episodes ago they played 'the drinking game' are you kidding me? Now he says a joke about three people walking into a bar.Gregor Clegane obviously also knows exactly where to go to find his culprits who murdered his 'friend'.The Daneyrys knows the exact time to arrive to save the day! Another convenient timing when we lost all hope for her! Thank you to whoever wrote this, you've ruined the best thing I've seen in my life, Game of Thrones. I highly recommend that you retake this episode and the rest of them because you've ruined Game of Thrones for most people in this episode and the thing is, this will impact all future episodes, not only with the characters that we know are alive, but how I look at Game of Thrones. Not as dark and realistic but biased and awful."
391," The End of Arya's Pointless Journey in Braavos
",7,False,"In Braavos, Lady Crane finds the wounded Arya hidden in her chamber. She stitches her wounds and gives a potion to Arya to sleep. When Arya wakes up, she finds that the Waif has just killed Lady Crane and wants to kill her. Arya flees and is hunted down by the Waif. In Riverlands, Clegane seeks revenge and hunts down the men from the Brotherhood without Banners that killed the settlers; he stumbles upon Beric that invites him to join his group. In Meereen, life seems to be normal; however the Masters send vessels to attack the city. In King's Landing, Cersei challenges the Faith Militant and Gregor defends her killing one fanatic that has attacked him. Out of the blue, King Tommen announces a surprising decision that affects his mother and Loras. Brienne unsuccessfully tries to convince Blackfish to surrender his castle to Jaime. But Jaime makes a deal with Edmure that is released, returns to the castle and surrenders it to Jaime. ""No One"" is an episode where Arya ends her pointless journey in Braavos. She has spent half season to join the criminal Jaqen and now she gives up. The poor Lady Crane dies for helping Arya. In Meereen, Daenerys returns in the moment that the city is under attack of the Masters. The Machievellian Jaime retakes Riverrun without bloodshed. The announcement of King Tommen is surprising and the consequences will certainly be bloody. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""No One"""
392," The collapse of causality
",4,False,"I have often commented on, and complained about, the simple fact that when the show stopped relying on GRRM's plot lines, lots of the characters' decision stopped making any sense, while events started unfolding in bizarre, unrealistic, and sometimes just plainly silly manner.And this episode is the apotheosis of that symptom. With the exception of the scenes involving Sandor Clegane's meeting with the Brotherhood without Banners, which was really good, and the ones in King's Landing, where Cersei first rejoices at Undead Gregor's skill in shielding her only to get another cold shower when her son outlaws trial by combat, nothing else in the episode makes much sense:Let's begin with Riverrun. Brienne has arrived (carrying over from the previous episode, distances and times are apparently no longer something anyone writing the script cares about) and convinces Jaime to give her a chance to convince Blackfish to leave the castle and follow her to Winterfell - now, previously, Jon Snow, after touring half the North in half a day, said he couldn't wait, but my guess is Brienne's journey across the continent and back again won't prevent her from joining the siege. It doesn't seem to take more than a couple of days. Well, unless you are Sam. I doubt he's gonna reach Oldtown in this season. He must be stuck in some temporal loop. But I'm getting carried away. After Brienne fails to convince Brynden, Jaime conjures the most idiotic plan conceived in the show, which relies on Edmure being an idiot, in addition to the vast majority of the Riverrun defenders also being morons. Suffice to say, it works. The Blackfish decides, for no half-good reason, to die. But after this comedy of a siege, we don't even get to see him fight. Brienne then leaves, and apparently doesn't care about Jaime not-quite-being-true to his promise.Meanwhile, Arya is found by Waif. And this time, all that I was pleased hadn't happened in the previous episode hits the fan. Arya has been stabbed many times in the groin. OK, she survives, it's not that weird - although she was stabbed by a skilled assassin. What is weird is how she can suddenly go into parkour mode, run, jump, fall, her guts not spilling, and then defeats her enemy. Because...she turned off the light? OK, I get it, but you'd think all that training Arya failed at? Wouldn't Waif have also passed through it? Like, successfully? And then Jaqen of course lets her go, because, well, who knows. Oh, we don't see this fight either. But OK, this was done in darkness. Let's say it's reasonable.Meanwhile in Meereen, no one has noticed that a huge fleet is approaching until the ships -LITERALLY- start bombarding the city. Thanks, greatest spy network in the world. Of course, it's also true no one had noticed that their queen had been missing for...well, long enough for half the armies of the world to go around the world a couple of times and return, by the looks of it, and long enough for Sam to cross an entire room. She, naturally, arrives just at the right moment (when has anything not gone the Daenerys way?). I take it no one noticed the Dothraki horde standing at the gates either. Why would they?"
393," Do people want to hate this episode?
",10,True,"It may be strange seeing a positive review for this episode, considering that the first reviews you'll see are incredibly negative and in my opinion, undeservedly so. This episode has great dialogue, funny interactions and steady plot development and closure for the Blackfish's story, defending his home to his dying breath. Firstly, Arya's story-line has gotten a lot of backlash. Why? Because people can't make any leaps in logic and just enjoy the show. I really get the vibe that people like hating on it as it seems everything they see as a negative could've easily been explained away if they just stopped to think about it. Okay, so she got stabbed. She made a mistake and apparently, that's out of character for her because apparently she's now a Mary Sue and can't make mistakes. Really?! She didn't know they were after her, which is evident when she asks Jaqen if he sent the Waif to kill her, so why should she be on high alert. We don't know how deep the stab wounds were as it was a small knife the Waif used, and I'm not a medical professional, but for plot's sake I can accept that it can be stitched up. But some may ask: ""How come an assassin failed to make any significant wounds?"". Well, because she clearly hated Arya and wanted to make her suffer instead of killing her instantly. After Arya is stitched up, we get a touching scene between her and Crane, reminding us that there's still some warmth left in her and she's not a full-blown murdering psychopath yet. Sadly, Lady Crane later dies in brutal fashion and Arya, who has been moderately stitched up & had time to recover, jumps out the window using her assassin skills. Granted, she's probably having an adrenaline rush as she's running for her life and therefore: briefly forgotten about her wounds until she falls down the stairs. Unfortunately, we don't get to see the fight, but it makes sense because there was no way Arya could fight her in daylight. I like the look of admiration on Jaqen's face as he watches her go, and some may ask why he didn't kill her. To those people, I say you haven't been paying attention. Many times did Jaqen go on about a face being added to the Hall, one way or another. He just didn't care who it was, so he lets her go. By the way, he didn't want her dead because she betrayed the Faceless Men's ways again, he wanted her dead because she didn't kill the woman for his God, so she was a substitute for Crane's death, but the Waif took Arya's place after all. This story-line may have gone on for a bit too long, but it wasn't pointless because now Arya can actually fight and she actually earned it. That's like saying Robb's story was pointless because he died before accomplishing anything. This episode isn't perfect, but I gave it a 10 because A: I liked it and B: to combat the overly-harsh low scores the episode is getting for unjust reasons. Quick flaws with the episode: Tyrion's interactions with Grey Worm and Missandei started off a bit repetitive, although it paid off in the end, and Dany's entrance could've been handled better. Also, I would've liked to have seen the Blackfish go with Brienne, but I understand why he didn't, though I would've liked to have seen him die in a blaze of glory as well as the Waif dying a very gory death. I would give this episode an 8.5/10 if it weren't for the overly harsh reviews."
394," Tasting as schizofrenia
",5,False,"Every time I confront myself against the path the mediocre script this season is following, very sadly I'm becoming more and more aware ""Game of Thrones"" has been loosing its best properties previously than I thought, since at least season 5. It's just a question of admitting or continue denying it. The main directors are really messing around and that's a fact.""Game of Thrones"" primordial soup is not just a fantastic-medieval piece of literature, it's a very realistic fiction primarily based upon historical plots, politics, war, lineages, conquering, civilization, humanity, and the representation of the collective medieval mentality about the unknown and its fantastic world of myths transposed into bestiaries... cool and eccentric, fashionable teens making acrobatic miracles in the air posing for the cameras with shining white teeth dressed for the occasion is simply not what I have in mind when I watch the series. Nothing against it but let's separate the weeds from the wheat: that job is for Peter Jackson.While Arya was being stabbed several times and yet she was able to escape, I silently cursed myself and everything related to the series but the joy of watching her surviving the attack surpassed my rationality. Generally speaking the last episode was quite good and a breath of fresh air to the whole season. Because of that I decided to stretch the reasonable possibilities to the boundaries of my rational acceptance: Arya was stabbed multiple times, although miraculously none of the stabs perforated a vital organ or artery, strange as it sounds when the person who perpetrated the crime is a master of disguises and assassination... a microscopical possibility, yet a possibility.Following this micro-argument, even if Arya was not stabbed on a vital organ, she was stabbed multiple times and unless she was wearing some sort of armour or protection, it's impossible for some part of her muscle tissue not to be ripped off in the process. The pain would be excruciated, and she wouldn't be able to move or breathe properly...Already feeling some salty sweat sliding through my forehead I remotely accepted the possibility of Arya's adrenaline levels getting too high so that it was possible for her to escape before her body collapsed, like when sadly a dog is mortally struck by a car yet he's still able to run for a quite long distance before he ultimately shuts down and die.Even if the sum of these two nano-possibilities might be proved to be true, even so, Arya would for certain, and at the best of the chances, lay down in a semi-state of coma when finally she would stop and her body would become idle, because she has lost huge amounts of blood and stressed her body to the limit in this whole process of escaping dangerously wounded.Essentially, even if Arya was living in the 21th century treated in the best hospitals by the best doctors, her chances of surviving would be tightened by a very thin line and it would be imperative for her to rest and to be accompanied by intensive medical care for at least (this is me stretching again) 2 months... Nevertheless, I embraced this hypothesis.After my mental odyssey has finally rested I thought that in the next episode I was going to see Arya fighting for her life in a razor's edge state of life and death of a delirious semi-coma. When in this episode she reaches and she's found by Lady Crane, I expected her to be nurtured by the tender hands of a soul who after all this years of disgrace and tragedy would at long last take the role of one the members of her lost family. It would be a great moment, to watch Arya helpless as a puppy, at the mercy of anything, like a child who's infancy and dreams have been shredded and has nothing to loose yet regained the comfort of a mother after a long waiting. She more than anyone deserves that little paradise and the healing process would take its time as also as the focus of the characters development...But... Bullocks! Rubbish... Arya wakes up with a ""hangover"" and a face of a smart ass and both women spoke trivially about some stupidities concerning soups, boyfriends and the art of stitching. Enough!!! Suddenly I became indisposed. What the hell is happening with the series?I believe there's no need to criticize more, because what follows is an escalate of absurdity and the watching of the worst kind of scripting. I felt disturbed. What saves this episode from sinking to the bottom is the work of some actors, the Costume and Wardrobe Department and the Artistic Department.Congratulations to Gwendoline Christie (Brienne) who was stupendous in her work. The photography was generally great, specially portraying the right atmosphere in the Lannister tent. Also the costumes were worthy of a medieval painting done by a master. Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau (Jaime) was also very good, and the dialogue between both characters was one of the few glimpses in this episode of the truly ""Game of Thrones"".So much time wasted with nonsense, futile jokes, minor characters as the Grey Worm and Missandei (totally flat character performances and developments), the ridiculous Daenerys Targaryen catwalk entry (copy and paste from pretty much all of the seasons 5 and 6), and so little time dedicated to strong actors and characters as Clive Russell and the Brotherhood Without Banners. What a shame.Honourable mention to Dean-Charles Chapman who's performance is as always flawless. His acting fits as a glove in the role of Tommen Baratheon.My only hope in the series now resides in Lady Stoneheart."
395," Beep
",1,False,"There aren't many words capable of describing this show's heinous vile act of inherent baboonery. It is absolutely unfathomable, completely and utterly unreasonable that this show represents the literature and is even found representing our culture. A show that even previously had the royals investment, now they air this tripe today? A show that prided itself as being better than Tolken? But there is no author on this planet who is even marginally as dyspraxic as this show. A show that literally makes no coherent attempts to formulate an otherwise plot. The characters portrayed are a pie in your face act, serving no functioning purpose outside of their disgustingly shown abilities. Was the money worth blighting our culture with this stain on humanity, surely there were other jobs for them to do just what? A show that simply wastes, for the wastefulness of it.The show has literally spoiled book 6 to rewrite book 5, why, delaying the printed literature, as the author has completely distanced from this atrocity. It had a purpose in its beginning season's telling a functioning story. Toady they go around and around in illogical circles acting like baboons (eating out of each others butts in false praise, being evolutionary devolved) for the sake of it. This season was supposedly suppose to be Winter, and I haven't seen nothing of consequence at all, just one stupid episode after the next stupider episode, although it had Hold the Door, the only episode that told a coherent story, haha.I cannot and will not be continuing watching this, reviewing it, or engaging in it further. I have placed a mental shield blocking myself from its cancer, and I couldn't even watch all of the episode last night, it was that bad, and I almost ripped my TV off the wall, proceeding to delete the entire box set. It has made me livid, seering in anger at its shown stupidity. It is simply not worth whatever its endings. It has almost got me making a bonfire out the literature, because it should not be representing anything at all when it is not even capable of making an otherwise story.In other reviews of fingers up each others bums leading to pie in the face repeated bloated head CGI acts. Brienne for no reason travels to Riverrun, meeting the biggest army Westeros has ever seen in the series. Why when both Riverrun and the Frey's had disappeared for entire seasons? She meets with the Blackfish who dies of baboonery and she waltzes off into the dusk. What was the point of that, nothing. Cersei was shamed for no reason, as she waltzes around the court and even her son is contradicting himself when he has proclaimed his faith. There was some other CGI spatter used to cement her baboonery as the Mountain makes stupid sparrows. Off to Meereen where somebody thinks that they are above their station, news flash you haven't got any Oscars and all you do is drink another bottle. Although tell me just why you made a broken deal, if you were even half as good at making them? Some CGI splats, presto Dany appears for no reason as her Dothrats are no where else. Braavos and CGI bandaging leads on to superpowers that literally fly away, adding night vision and taxidermy. What was the point of that entire arc and time spent, literally nothing.Beep, no beep you beeps, beeping the beep out of beep, wasting all that beep on beep, you aren't worth beep. BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP. Everybody now and altogether BEEP, it feels much better, BEEP it all out. I am all out of BEEP now, never again.

396," I was shocked.
",1,False,"First of all, there have always been episodes that are rather slow- paced or flawed or unpopular for other reasons. It is not possible to write perfect scenes all the time or have a climax at the end of every episode, so even when I'm critical about GoT I can always understand why they chose to do a scene or a story-line the way they did it. This time, however, is entirely different. The episode felt to me like I was eating a really nice, delicious(mostly) cake, but there's a dead rat baked inside, which stands for Arya's story-line. The rest of the episode might have been quite nice, but no matter how much you like the cake around it, the dead rat inside makes it irrelevant. All you want to do is throw up. That's why I will jump straight to Braavos and ignore all the rest of the episode and that's also why I had to give it a rating of 1 instead of more than that.I think AltShiftX, who is a very qualified Youtuber/GoT-critic with a lot of knowledge of the story, explains it better than me, so watch his video for in-depth-analysis. I'll make this criticism short, because sadly they're never going to read it anyway.The big catastrophe is the way how Arya got wounded. Probably the shows biggest strength is its tension through the rule that no one in this story is entirely save, just because they're fan-favorites. Death is lurking around every corner in this world and when you get stabbed in the abdomen(multiple times), there's no hiding under a dumpster, you're just dead, period. With that rule established, of course fans started theorizing what could be the conclusion to that, because clearly Arya had suffered wounds that would kill her without a doubt, so, either she was going to die or there was going to be a big twist. (There wouldn't be so many people expecting a twist, if the writers hadn't done a terrible job this time) However, we learned that all she had to do to heal her deadly wounds was to have some soup and a nap. That's ridiculous. It made me so sad, because at that moment I thought 'all right, that's it, the best show ever has finally become as inconsequential as Hollywood-Blockbuster'.The problem about it are: 1. From now on every time someone gets stabbed it's going to have much less emotional impact. Even wounds that would undoubtedly kill you in our world(where we have modern medicine and stuff) are heal-able if you're wearing enough plot-armor. 2. The trust in the plot-hole-free writing of Dan, Dave and Brian (and Dave) has crumbled. From no on when something leads to an inevitable death I can't trust them anymore that they won't take a cheap illogical way to prevent a characters death. The certainty of logic is gone. 3. In retrospective the plot of two seasons lead up to no more than a chase-scene where you knew Arya, with her magical healing- abilities, would not be in real danger at any time.That's what separated Got from other shows and movies: There are no immortal heroes. There's no Aragorn-like character who wouldn't even have to bring a sword to the fight, because he knew he's the main- character and the writer won't dare to kill him. From no on I can't be certain about that anymore.Please never pull such a cheap Hollywood-trick on the audience again, ever!"
397," Forshadowing Greatness.
",10,True,"I'm totally surprised to read lots of reviews stating how the episode disappointed and isn't enough for an 8th episode. Well, the 2nd and 5th episode this season were a lot more satisfying and shocking than any other 2nd or 5th episode of any season. And in my opinion you can't have a plot twist or an ultimate shock every other episode. The last 3 episodes have made a lot of foreshadowing about what's coming next in the best way possible. The story is now connected more than ever. In this episode we see strong dialogues, characters returning, building up for the Brotherhood, the Hound, Arya's return to Westeros, Dany's story-line , Cersie's total madness, the battle of bastards and for the great battle against the dead and much more story lines to get excited to. Thrones is taking us to a showtime phase after seasons of preparing- Dany is as ready as never to take back the throne, Arya is on her way back to check everything on her list, Bran's knowledge is nearly complete about fighting the white walkers and King's landing faces a near collapse, showing that the vicious-circled fight to the Iron Throne isn't the main theme, but the big battle against the dead. This episode builds up a lot, where the scenes were very well-made, but the thing is- now, we have high hopes for the things to come. Can't wait to see what will D&D and HBO bring us in the last two episodes and for next seasons to come. Winter is here!"
398," What is wrong with you, Benioff & Weiss?
",5,False,"Oh, it could be a great episode, giving the plot of Arya one twist to justify the scene of the previous episode and give meaning to their entire stay in Bravos. But not. Screw the consistency and continuity. But before we talk about the other cores. King's Landing: seen by Mountain will not have much use for Cersei, as the High Sparrow is always forward and made his puppet king, prohibit trials by combat; and choose the violence did not help much to Cersei. Riverlands: Jaime, who stupid you came to be. Seriously Edmure simply changed his mind? And Black Fish deserved a more dignified death. Oh, thanks not turned all the Brotherhood criminals, and they still follow a purpose. Meereen: however it is important to show Tyrion interacting with other allies of Daenerys, really need to waste so much screen time with jokes? Daenerys this you will have to deal with a big problem. Let us now return to the plot that has made this one of the worst episodes of the series. Seriously we have to accept that Areo Hotah died from a single stab while Arya survived normally after your gut punched several times? It is serious that the whole scene of episode 7 was a discontinuity and that she was actually walking quietly by Bravos without needle, even though he was sworn death? The actress really had money to pay the Faceless Men and that this was not a test? Jaqen that will just let it go and two seasons in the House of Black and White not served a higher purpose? Oh, this is probably the last episode 8 that the series will have. They could have respected the tradition of the last two seasons and made something memorable, but preferred to drive the story of Arya horribly and ruin the episode."

From start to finish, from Daenerys embracing her Targaryen identity and allying with the Greyjoys to Jon's battle for his family and ancestral home and Sansa's long-awaited revenge, this episode was definitely the best of the show so far. My congratulations to the actors, the writers and the marvellous director, who is proved to be the best among the most talented directors HBO has employed during these 6 seasons of the show. Kit Harington's portrayal made me cry, cheer and fear for Jon. As of Ramsay, farewell bastard and rot in hell. As of Iwan Rheon, farewell you immensely talented actor, we will definitely miss you.

402," Greatest Television Episode in History!
",10,True,"After a slow last three episodes, Season 6 Episode 9 reminded all of us why Game of Thrones is not only the best television series currently airing, but the best television show of all time. This cements Season 6 of Game of Thrones as one of the top 3 seasons so far. The episode began with an intense scene that returned a much-needed adrenaline rush to Daenerys' storyline. That alone would have been an outstanding highlight of any Game of Thrones episode, but immediately after we switch to Jon's storyline and witness a suspenseful and outstanding battle with satisfying action and resolution. I've never witnessed a greater battle in all of television and film. Although the battle in Lord of the Rings was much larger with a higher budget, Battle of the Bastards pulls on our heart strings with characters we have both loved and hated for years and gives us a real experience of medieval combat. The camera-work, directing, acting, writing and special effects was all perfect. I wouldn't dare spoil this episode for anyone, as it was a complete privilege to watch. Through all the sorrow, triumph and heart- pounding action, all I can say is this: The North Remembers."
403," Far and away, one of the greatest episodes of TV
",10,True,"I just can't describe this. It was hyped up. The fight was coming. The fight that I just witnessed was the single most intense hour of television I have ever seen. I normally don't write reviews but this one needed it. I was wondering how it would play out, but this...I can't describe it. There were moments throughout the season, the subtle build-ups, the exposition, the intensity, that led me to believe this season would not disappoint. I did not expect it to culminate the way it did. I did not expect the production, the battle itself, everything came together as perfect as anything I've ever seen. I'm not one to get easily influenced physically by movies or TV, but my adrenaline was rushing through the entire episode. Game of Thrones topped everything they have ever done and I can't wait to see the consequences and results of the events in this episode."
404," Visceral, cinematic and incredibly thrilling.
",10,True,"Holy hell! What a battle! This episode contained the single greatest battle sequence ever made for television, and I would even say it ranks high compared to movies. Miguel Sapochnik is now officially the best director on Game of Thrones (he also did last year's Hardhome). The pacing, the cinematography, the acting, the writing; everything in here was perfect. It depicts the horrors of war in such a brutal and stunning way. It feels like they've finally got the budget to take the series to the scale they've always wanted it at. Just an all around epic episode. It also plays sharp contrast to last week's episode, which I personally found slightly disappointing.Surprisingly, the episode isn't just set in one location (although it almost is). We also check in with Meereen, which is good because I thought the cliffhanger they were left on last episode would stretch for two weeks. It didn't. The episode leaps right into it. This was quite a smart pacing decision; by opening the episode with a battle, you prevent people from getting fed up with the long stretch of character scenes that precedes the other battle. Just the right amount of time was spent in Meereen this episode.But then, of course, it's on to the main event. The Battle of the Bastards. As with all the other big battle episodes in Game of Thrones, we check in with all the characters who will be fighting in the battle. It reminds us of the stakes, develops character, and builds anticipation.In this episode, we see that Ramsay is in fact a brilliant strategist. His battle plan is horrifying, manipulative, and very well thought out. The effects on the ground are very well portrayed. There is one tracking shot that follows a character through the battle that absolutely blew me away. It captures the sheer senselessness, the pure chaos of battle in such a mind-blowing way. The only thing I found even marginally disappointing about this episode was the character deaths; I wish there were more of them! But that's probably just me being masochistic.What an absolutely fantastic ride of an episode, I hope the finale delivers."
405," The triumph of television
",10,True,"Every once in a while you come across something that you know outright to be a masterpiece. It doesn't happen very often and usually even the greatest feats of cinema you have to watch a few times to appreciate the grandeur you have just witnessed. Game of Thrones is known for its strong 9th episodes on almost every season. Season 6 is no different with ""Battle of the Bastards"". It's a one hour television episode that truly feels like a massive budget blockbuster movie.This episode gives Game of Thrones fans almost one hour spectacle filled with action. However, the action is paced superbly with absolutely wonderfully acted and written dialogue. The episode involves many great changes, twists and turns. Episode director Miguel Sapochnik (also known for his another masterpiece episode ""Hardhome"") proves himself to be once and for all one of the greatest talents in the television and movie industry today. There are dozens of shots in this episode that I can't even begin to comprehend how on earth were they filmed. The action coordination combined with the great camera angles make some of the most memorable scenes I have ever seen in television.I don't want to go too much on details about the story itself, since this is best experienced without knowing too much about what is going to happen. All I can say is that all the story lines involved in this episode move forward just perfectly. Watching it all unfold on the screen creates an emotional roller coaster I've never seen in a Game of Thrones episode before. And that is saying a lot, considering how magnificent feats Game of Thrones has managed to pull through during its six seasons.I can safely say that this is my favorite Game of Thrones episode so far and season 6 is on it's way to become my favorite season. Something I didn't expect myself ever saying after finishing season 4 almost two years ago."
406," I am literally shaking!!!
",10,True,"Wow, just F***ing wow!!!! This episode is without question the greatest Game of Thrones episode, and perhaps the greatest episode in TV history, surpassing Ozymandias from Breaking Bad.From the beginning of this episode to the very last second, was heart pounding. The visual effects during the first 10 minuets were the greatest in TV, it was perfection, even some great Hollywood blockbusters couldn't create effects like this. Seeing Dany how she was here makes me so freaking excited to see her ride in on her dragons in the later seasons. Seeing her relationship with Tyrion unfold was a delight to see, and I believe they will make the best duo yet.Now to the big stuff. I loved this part of the episode solely because it treated the battle with a serious notion, and not just good vs evil. I love Lord of the Rings, it is the best movie trilogy out there, but even those movies could not match the furiosity of this battle. It was bloody, it was gritty and extremely intense. Kit as Jon Snow gives a Golden Globe worthy nomination, and he really shines here as our hero. This episode is directed to perfection, and I hope the director gets to do some future movies, because he built up suspension at the start, and kept it going until the very end. Battle of the Bastards is the greatest Game of Thrones episode yet, it is also one of the most realistic battle scenes I have ever seen, giving the battle in Braveheart a run of its money. It was a non-stop roller coaster and I will simply say, that to everyone who does like it, go watch some MTV crap, because this has officially went down in TV history.10/10"
407," The best Episode of GOT
",10,True,"It's 3:10am in UK and I got work tomorrow but can't sleep due to the adrenaline flow after watching this marvel. Hands down the best episode of GOT. You live the WAR as you have never I mean reliving Braveheart all over again. Is this a TV show? Unbelievable. After last episode there was too much negativity and rightly so as Arya and Blackfish story lines were looking a bit rushed an inconclusive. But as the norm goes with GOT and as after slow season 5 we had ""Hardhome"", this time around we have this masterpiece from the same director. Without giving too much away buckle up, you are in for a treat son."
408," One of the best if not THE best medieval battle sequences of all time
",10,True,"Truly an amazing episode. From the cinematography to the acting - masterful. The shot of Davos during the sunrise, the moment Jon gets trampled under all the soldiers, Daenarys on Drogon and one of the best shots in all of the series: Jon running in to battle. When Jon was being trampled, I could hardly breath. That gives you a sense of how claustrophobic and chaotic this battle really was. The scene when Jon slowly walks towards Ramsay, blocking his arrow and then beats him to a pulp, followed by him being eaten by his own dogs - just amazing. This episode made that boring thing we got last week worth it. Probably the best episode of the whole series. 11/10"
409," One of the most thrilling battle scenes of the show
",10,True,"Without giving much away, I can say with absolute certainty that the battle scene of this episode is by far the most cinematographically breathtaking visual representation of a battle. All the shots are great, it becomes evident to everyone how much time and energy was invested in the making of this episode. Apart from this, there are other things happening in this one-hour long episode, which are also terribly needed for future development of the show. What may HBO have for us in the season finale? Guess we'll have to see, but in the meantime we can rest assured that every time Miguel Sapochnik directs an episode we are going to be shocked and amazed at the same time. This guy really knows his stuff!"
410," These Hounds Ain't Loyal
",10,True,"This episode did not disappoint; all of the action, heartbreak, suspense and horror - typical of a ninth episode of Game of Thrones - were present.I was surprised to see Daenerys and Tyrion featured at all, never mind Theon and Yara. I expected it to be akin to season four's episode nine battle, which spent the entire duration focusing on the battle. This particular episode did not - like last season's Hardhome - and I believe this diversity of story lines is part of what makes this so spectacular.Daenerys' storyline was nicely wrapped up, albeit briskly, and has already began setting up for next season as we can clearly see where she's headed: Westeros! The slave masters surely won't be foolish enough to attempt another siege on Meereen once Daenerys and the gang have left - Drogon saw to that.The main battle was, at first, a total disaster. Jon did exactly what Ramsay wanted him to, which is exactly what Sansa told him not to. His inability to adapt and take on the advice of his sister almost cost him his life, and the lives of all of his soldiers. Luckily, Sansa foresaw this defeat and sent a raven to Littlefinger, changing her mind and requesting the aid of the Knights of the Vale. They arrived just in time - like it or not - and turned the tides in the Starks' favour. Ramsay, as predicted, fled back to Winterfell with his tail between his legs when he saw his men fall. He may be sadistic and he may know how to toy with people, but he's no military expert and he most certainly shouldn't have killed his father, Roose Bolton; he could've used his cunning mind ahead of this battle.Nevertheless, we finally got what we've all been waiting for. But was it satisfying enough? Jon's pummelling of his wretched face made me cheer in front of the screen, encouraging him to go on. I was frustrated when he paused, but the way he went out was so fitting and felt like justice. The fear that crept into his voice as he realised how he was going to die made it all the more pleasing. Ramsay was, for once, truly afraid, and that may have been most the pleasing thing of all. Sansa's smirk at the end of the episode mirrors how we all felt watching that scene: euphoric. He got what he deserved.Sadly, being the ninth episode of the season, this now means there's only a single episode left for us to watch this year. Thankfully, it's going to be the longest episode we've ever had, and we've got a lot to look forward to.Farewell, Bastard."
411," The North Rises
",10,True,"For as long as Game of Thrones waits to pay story lines and plot points off, it sure is satisfying when it's done right. Tonight just about went down the way I thought it would, but that didn't take away from the brilliance of the episode on all fronts.I didn't think we would get anything besides the battle brewing in the North, but we got a decent amount of Meereen material. We saw Daenerys ride her Drogon again a few weeks back, but seeing her tear right through any hopes The Masters had of taking down Meereen was just awesome. Throw in the appearance of all 3 dragons together in one continuous shot sent chills down my spine.It's hard to come out of the episode not thinking about that final shot in Winterfell, but the Greyjoys meeting with Tyrion and Dany deserves some attention as well. Not only was it nice to hear some more history behind these two families, but I believed every word coming from both sides. For once it seems this house alliance makes sense and won't end in tragedy.But onto the North, I think the battle went down pretty much the way people speculated, but I dug every second of it. Everything from the devastation in Jon Snow's eyes when he sees his brother die to the sweeping long shots of swords, arrows, and horses flying all over the place made 'Battle of the Bastards' one for history books. Everyone behind the scenes deserves a ton of credit for this one.Even the stuff that went past the battlefield like the Jon and Sansa conflict was well done. Over the course of the show they haven't had the lengthy screen time that other duos have, but they are now consistently one of the best acted and written parts of the show. Same goes for the back and forth between Tormund and Daavos and even Ramsay and Jon. Absolutely loved it.It's only fitting Ramsay gets eaten by his own dogs. Of course, he had to get his final tragic game in by killing Rickon. That was unfortunate. But I've been pulling for Ghost to get the kill for quite some time now, but I think I can settle for Ramsay's hounds. Goes right next to Joffrey as probably the most satisfying death in the show's history. Sansa's final smirk though? Perfect.There were a few things here and there that didn't work as well though. Daavos conveniently finding Shireen's little toy in the wood felt a little forced, but it will certainly have an impact going forward. There were also times the editing and cuts inside the battlefield that made it difficult to see what was going on. But nitpicks for sure. 'Battle of the Bastards' is one of the best pieces of art this show has given us in its 6 year run, and I can only hope next week has a similar effect.+Goodbye Ramsay+That battle tho+Sansa's subtle smile+Greyjoy and Targaryen alliance makes sense10/10"
412," Truly Epic
",10,True,"The Battle of Bastards is the Greatest Battle ever in the History of Television and Game of Thrones. The Episode was very Satisfying in terms of Action, Drama, Thrill, Battle and Kills.In Mereen, The Mother of Dragons would be glad to have Tyrion and Drogon on her side from now on. A new bond between to become Queens was also interesting.In North, The Battle, Oh My God!! It was something I have never ever witnessed. The Detail, the Armies, the Fight, everything was Incredible. The Game Ramsey played was so Ramsey. And the role Sansa took was so Stark. She really proved she is Ready to be the Lady of Winterfell."
413," A great episode
",10,True,A great episode featuring one of the greatest battles and Ramsay's death healing the trick
414," Game of thrones returns, amazing !!
",10,True,"Episode 9 gives you the original taste of the Game of Thrones. Wao again I am going to watch it. After watching the last three episodes of this season I think that when it will be going to more excited. Finally, episode 9 break my expectation. What a war!! Yes, after 'The Rains of Castamere', 'Hardhome' and 'The Door' now 'The Battle of Bastards' is the greatest of Game of thrones. Best war direction, best visualization. Jon Snow is always best. What a performance by Iwan Rheon as Ramsay Bolton throughout the whole season. How can I now wait for next episode! When next Sunday will be come! Everyone should give 10/10 rating."
415," Quite possibly the best episode in all of TV.
",10,True,"This episode is to the series what Goodbye Farewell, and Amen was to Mash, and Ozymandias to Breaking Bad...a classic series episode that prepares the viewer for what's next in the future. The battle scenes in this episode are the best ever made for television, and at a big cost. The locations where this show is filmed is very exotic, and the characters and dragons rule the show. The music is amazing as well as the pace of the show. If you have to see just one episode of GOT, this is the one."
416," The Starks send their regards
",10,True,"Guys, as you all know, Hardhome is a masterpiece in every single way. The battle, the angle of the cameras, the fights, the screenplay, and every little detail. Well guess what? This episode tops it. It's not just an ""episode"", but it's the best episode that has appeared on television (or HBO) thus far in history. WOW. The set up of the battle was beautiful. Davos founding Shireen's doll, and the conversation Jon and Mellisandre had, and even the hilarious conversation between Tormund and Davos. But, the conversation between Jon and Sansa is very important due to their difference of opinion. But the climax hit when Rickon was shot by Ramsay. I thought that he was saved to be honest but that's why the director had done it again. It was a misdirection for most of us viewers but Rickon did die and that was when Jon had the anger to fight. The battle was brutal, violence, intense, and gory. It was perfect. There has not been any war movie that I have seen that has top that scene. And yes, it was better than Braveheart or Troy (my favorite medieval movie of all time). I was shaking the entire hour of this episode. It was again a MASTERPIECE. When Sansa brought the cavalry, AND I LITERALLY MEANT SHE BROUGHT A F**KING CAVALRY. IT WAS F**KING AWESOME. My days, I thought Jon was done. I thought he has lost the battle because you know Game of Thrones can kill Jon for the second time, but there will be no point on reviving him. So Sansa. She came, she saw, and she conquered. I love her character. (But I hope Little Finger doesn't turn on her)Not to leave out Daenerys' part of this episode, which was totally badass and awesome by the way. It was also cool to see her and Tyrion work together, and for a moment I thought she had something going on with Yara (Hey you know what I mean). Nevertheless, not a single episode of any show has top this episode, and it tops Hardhome, which was a masterpiece. This is the reason Game of Thrones is the best on show TV now because no other shows can be even close to top it. ""Battle of the Bastards"" will get a rating of 11/10. It's more than just a masterpiece."
417," Best Battles so far
",10,True,"****CONTAINS SPOILERS*** Danny was not to happy about the state of Mereen, but couldn't expect anything less from the way it was left. She takes a much more aggressive approach then Tyrion in response to the attack. Daario is right, Danny is a great conqueror and commander, not the greatest ruler. Danny takes a flight over Mereen to take on the master's fleet while the Dorthraki deal with the sons of harpy. The arrival or Danny's dragons, Danny riding Drogon and the Dothraki Khalasar was spectacular. The dragons torch all of the the ships of Volantis, Astapor and Yunkai. Ramsay and Jon exchange terms. Sansa and Jon discuss Ramsay. Ramsay underestimates Jon and his army while Jon underestimates Ramsay initially. Yara and Theon make a deal with Danny's. Battle of the bastard begins.One of the greatest medieval battles on TV and film let alone in the series.Easily the most intense battles which felt like movie quality production and effects.Ramsay is much more organized and has much more men at first and better formations, until help arrives. Ramsay offers Rickon a game to offer him a way out. Roose made a correct prediction about people like Ramsay and the fate they eventually receive. One of the best episodes of the entire series. Wasn't without its character losses, but a battle victory comes at a price, but at least we got a decent outcome for our wishes. There was some nice justice we finally got. Enjoy it,we do not get much happiness and justice in GOT. Ramsay starts to go out as you would expect of Ramsay, but then we see a vulnerable Ramsay and some real revenge from characters he has played with."
418," Jawdroppingly compelling
",10,True,"This episode reminded me of why I watch this show. After some sluggish episodes, the change in pace was refreshing and warmly welcomed. It's brutal and visceral but still has enough compulsion to get your emotions up in the air.I fully expected this episode to focus on in the brewing battle at the North, but it surprisingly starts off as a continuation of last week's episode. And this surprise adds even more to the episode. Daenerys is not the best ruler as we all know, but surprisingly she showed that she is wise in this episode by heeding to Tyrion's advice, which adds more complexities to her character. Tyrion-Dany partnership might just work on her favour, and I expect some dynamics between them next season. Not to mention the reunion of her three Dragons was thrilling and was one of the highlight of the episode, it sent down chills down my spine and had me on the edge of my seat. The CGI was epic for a TV show. The storyline also had the first confrontation between the Greyjoy siblings and Dany, which is a good suspenseful bid to pave way for her for the next season when she travels to the West.Now the battle between the two Bastards (namesake of the episode) was something I had been looking forward to since some episodes ago, and holy! The battle was executed so darn well. It was gritty, yet emotive. At first the battle goes awry for the Starks, but Sansa showed immense wiseness by swallowing her pride. Now don't get me wrong, Sansa has not my favourite character in the series, but the growth she has shown since season one is marvelous and Sophie's portrayal of her character complements it even more. I was not a happy viewer when the writers decided to bring back Jon because as a book reader I wanted Lady Stoneheart (aka Catelyn) to be the one to be back, but I can see why they made that decision. I could see vast glimpse of Lady Stoneheart's coldness in Sansa in this episode, especially at the brutal ending.The second highlight of the episode was the brutal ending to Ramsay. I could not help but shout with glorious retribution at the way his character met his death. Kudos to the writers! And that cold smile Sansa had, total Lady Stoneheart moment. Inspite of the thrilling, satisfying moment, the episode was not without emotions. I also wept for the horses that died (poor animals!).Anyway, I can say without a doubt that this has been the best episode this season, and had one of the best battle sequence in TV history. 10/10"

",10,True,"Wow.. just wow.. This is with out a doubt the greatest episode in the history of television. Not.. It's the greatest hour of any show/film ever. Every second of this hour long episode was gold. The writing, acting direction, scale and effects are just mind blowing good. This episode won the most amount of Emmys for an episode ever. And you can see why when watching this masterpiece. The main Battle sequence was the best battle I have seen on screen in my entire life. This is why this is the best show ever made. Their will never be another Game of Thrones. Never, never, never."
423," Expectedly Awesome
",10,True,"Game of Thrones is known for hair-curling suspense, mighty action sequences, unexpected revelations, emotional rollercoasters and saddening deaths.We found them all in good proportions in this episode. Every season's ninth episode ends up being the most hyped and loved one. Be it the Red Wedding or Baelor or Blackwater. The thing about these episodes is that, despite focusing on multiple story lines, each plot shows an eyebrow-raising and/or satisfaction-inducing scene. Battle of Bastards lives up to the standards.The episode opens with Daenerys' angst and revelation of her Mad King father-like tendencies. But we find a positive light. We see that she is strong, confident and power-loving, but she is also understanding. She is open to criticism, opposition and learning the politics and policies. She understands when someone is intelligent and listens to their counsels. But she also has enough fire in her to gain control of the situation.The way she burns the attacking party is a spellbinding spectacle. Dragons finally in action, Grey Worm's badass selective killing of the masters, Tyrion's expertise in policies, Yara's to the point proposal all make the Meereen scene perfect. Despite the excitement for the Winterfell scene, the audience will find themselves buying the Meereen plot with full satisfaction.Coming to the Winterfell plot, Sansa and Jon's argument is very well portrayed. The director aces the expression of Jon's experience hindering his sight of Ramsay's techniques very well. Sansa holding strong, despite the knowledge of high plausibility of Rickon's death has been very well acted.Then comes the battle scene. Indescribably good. It's Miguel Sapochnik. You can trust the man. The multiple deaths were predictable, yet saddening. The arrival of Knights of Vale was predictable, yet their attack on the Ramsay army was thrilling.The end of Ramsay was reminiscent of the end of Joker in Batman: The Dark Knight. The psychopathic laughter and the overconfidence and then his own hounds eating him up, expected and satisfying.So, in the North scene, nothing completely unexpected happened, but whatever did was satisfying and I wouldn't have wanted the stream to flow any other way.Hence a 10/10."
424," I actually cried
",10,True,"You can ignore my 10/10, this episode goes far beyond IMDB's rating system.
If Battle of the Bastards is perfection we need a new name for Winds of Winter. It simply does not get any better than this. I don't use the word ""Flawless"" lightly but it's the only word that comes to my mind when thinking of this episode.
I showed this episode to my parents who generally hates the adventure/fantasy genre and it convinced them to give the show a a chance.
The visuals, the acting, the score and basically everything about this episode is impossible to resist regardless of your taste.
Television at it's absolute finest!"
425," The beginning of the end
",10,True,"What a fantastic season finale. It had everything I could have hoped for and more (except maybe Cleganebowl and Lady Stoneheart... you can't have everything). I was admittedly quite nervous going into this episode; there was so much they had to stuff in. There was the distinct possibility of this episode becoming way too crammed with things and coming across rushed, like last season's finale did. Well, I can now safely say that I need not have worried. This episode balanced everything marvellously. There were massive violent twists and big moments, but they were laced in equally with touching little character interactions. In fact, the sequence that I had assumed would be the climax of this episode ended up being at the very beginning. And what a wonderful sequence it was. Ramin Djawadi did excellent work with the score accompanying the scene; it really helped to draw out the tension.During the first three seasons, there were certainly a lot of story lines, but they all tied back into one central story-line for the most part; the war of the five kings. The Red Wedding changed all if that; sent everyone their separate ways. As a result, the story lines drifted farther and farther apart from each other as time went on. That was fine in season 4, when they were all very eventful. But in season 5, when we were in a slower stage of the story, some people felt understandably frustrated. There was no sense of general momentum running through the whole of the show. D&D knew this, and so they were anxious to get through it as quickly as possible which led to some of it coming across rushed. People started saying that the show had lost its edge. But I don't think that's what it was. I think it was just in the middle chapter. The ""Two Towers"" of the Song of Ice and Fire saga. What this season has done is brought things back together. These characters, with their new experiences, are put back into the game. The middle chapter is over, and that has never been clearer than it was at the end of this episode. Three sides have emerged. All the houses have rallied to one side or another. Every story-line comes into play at the end of this episode and it is thrilling (except for Gendry... I guess he's still rowing). Things are in place for the final two seasons. Here we go.One last note; I'm pretty sure that thing suspended from the ceiling in the Oldtown library is the sun thing from the opening credits. That's a pretty cool detail."
426," Best episode yet!
",10,True,"I love that most of the fan theories came true. I love the fact that even though Jon Snow is a bastard (as far as others know) he's still held high by the northeners. I absolutely loved little Mormont, she shows her claws and is not afraid to stand up for what she believes in. The actress is the best one they could have casted. I completely agree with how things turned out in King's Landing, it was the most poetic scene i've seen come to television as of yet.That was the last place I expected to see Varys and i'm happy to see Littlefinger's game didn't turn out the way he wanted. I believe Game of Thrones fans finally got an ending they deserved and a fistful of justice has been done.The ending made me take a deep breath and I patiently await the quake of the next season. P.S> Ser Davos's performance was outstanding, it brought me tears and made me care for someone I didn't knew I cared for anymore."
427," The greatest season finale that has ever been on TV.
",10,True,"Episode 9 of Game of Thrones is usually the best of the season and the following finale is more of a lay down for stories to come. But not this season. After Battle of the bastards which was a masterpiece we all thought this was going to be a calm down finale but hell no. We got another masterpiece.Let me start of with negatives cause there really isn't anything negative about this episode other than, since the episode was called The winds of winter I expected some bit of White walkers.Now the positives. Everything. Everything really. Music was a real standout. Blowing up the sept was great, tragic end to Margarey and Tommen too but true highlight was Cersei, the best and most complex villain on Game of Thrones and on TV probably. ""Long may she reign!"". Now long may the White wolf, the king in the north Jon Stark/Targaryen(finally confirmed yeahhhh). Lyanna Mormont was amazing once again. The flashback was great. And everything Dany, finally leaving Mereen and sailing to Westeros. That end with that music was epic. And yes Arya is back too in the best possible way. 10/10 - masterpiece of television."

",10,True,"How can you write a review and not have any spoilers? I will attempt that. Game of Thrones doesn't disappoint and which each episode, you think you can't be surprised any further and you do. This episode was magnificently Shakespearean. It moves the story forward and it ends in an acceptable place. This thing played like an orchestra. Dare I say it..it has Godfather like quality to it. It is better than any movie I've seen in a long time and you will be very excited to talk about with your other GoT friends. And its so nice to see how each of these characters are so different from Season 1 Episode 1. Its just simply a brilliant show."

How do you top the best episode of television of all time? Apparently with far and away the best television episode of all time. I expected the credits 20 minutes in and realized there was still almost an hour left.I was an early cynic/critic of this season and I feel that was was a justifiable opinion but that was the best movie of the year and it was a TV show. Hell they even made the sand snakes interesting again by infusing Olenna who is the absolute best when it comes to banter. Watching her crap all over them was the fan service everyone deserved. Everything was shot beautifully, everything was perfectly paced. Everything was everything."
431," Best season finale in TV history and best episode to date for Game of Thrones
",10,True,"I don't have enough words to describe the magnificence of this episode. This has got to be the best overall episode in TV history. Battle of the Bastards was a masterpiece itself, but this episode brings so much more. Its the suspense, the music, the action and everything else that makes this episode far superior than the last epic battle. It is by far the best episode of the season, and the show itself! Not only did the episode conclude most of the story lines that were in question (like, when will Danerys head to Westeros?), but it sets the stage for an epic Season 7. The death of Tommen was very unexpected, as well as the death of Margaery. This shows how brutal Cercei can be when she feels threatened or cornered. I am sure she is capable of destroying the whole city if the odds turn worse for her. This episode truly showed who she really is, and what she can become.The episode in its entirety is outstanding. The directing and musical production was brought to a whole new level. It is that attention to detail that makes Game of Thrones the best series to have EVER aired on TV! I sure hope that Miguel Sapochnik gets chosen for the remaining episodes of season 7 and season 8. Only he has proved what this show can really be and what it is worth."
432," The greatest thing ever on TV.
",10,True,"After another flawless episode like ""Battle of the Bastards"", ""The Winds of Winter"" sets the bar higher. During its 68 minutes it never disappoints the audience: Beginning with the flawless scene of the explosion of the Sept of Baelor, through the scene of Daenerys' fleet, every moment is absolutely breathtaking. Tommen's suicide, Cersei torturing Septa Unella, Arya's revenge on Walder Frey, ""King in the North!"" in Winterfell and Bran's vision are the perfect scenes, which makes the episode spectacularly glorious. Besides the scenes, the direction, the writing, music, and Lena Headey's performance are the other highlights of the episode. ""The Winds of Winter"" overtakes Breaking Bad's respectably perfect ""Ozymandias"" in terms of excitement and greatness on TV.TV has never had a greater hour in its history. Game of Thrones will probably never have a greater episode- though I gladly wish to be mistaken about this (since TV REALLY needs such great moments), I think nothing on TV will ever surpass this."
433," Wow
",10,True,"Simply Astonishig. The music is just perfect.
A perfect almost 25 minute start sequence like I have never seen in my life.Game of Thrones turns around once again."
434," An Benchmark for how an SEASON FINALE should be done !!!
",10,True,"How do you top one of the best episode in the TV history??simple, By creating another episode with absolute perfection. DAMN Miguel Sapochnik is one hell of a director(Gift,Hardhome, BoB and now WoW), producers should use him to direct every episode of the coming seasons. WOW Just WOW what more can you say, this is how a season finale should be done, with perfection,clarity and little bit of anxiety for the next season. The episode started slowly , but it picked up on the way and it was great seeing every questions, stories are cleared and connected without losing the clarity. Acting was just top notch, Ser Davos was breathtaking, Lady Mormont damn she is one hell of a actress, the dialogues and the expression was superb and rest was below these guys.(not too down :P) The best thing was the BGM it was Hans Zimmer like, TAKE A BOW RAMIN DJAWADI, you were the soul of this episode without you it would not have the desired effect. It would take one hell of a episode to break the bar set by WoW (hoping for one). if you missed this, for any reason watch it at the earliest, because it is something that should not be missed :)"
435," Incredible!
",10,True,"This was the best episode, if I dare say, of the entire show. From the piano/cello duet that is throughout, to every persons part of the story. So so good."
436," Winter is Here
",10,True,"Coming off one of the best episodes of any show of all time with last week's 'Battle of the Bastards', it was going to be hard for Game of Thrones to create something even remotely as great. To me, 'The Winds of Winter' may be even better. Not only did it give us the final shot we wanted (Daenerys riding to Westeros), but it also concluded just about every major season 6 arc in the most satisfying way possible. I don't often praise the writing and directing in TV Shows, but if there was ever a time, it is now.As episode 9's central conflict was the battle for the North, the trial in King's Landing was the big event in episode 10. And boy did it not disappoint. I think just about everyone was getting fed up with the High Sparrow, so to see him go up in the flames of wildfire was extremely overdue. With that said, Cersei's descend into madness didn't go without its unfortunate consequences as both the king and the queen met their end. Tommen's suicide seemed like a fitting way for a coward like him to go out. On the other hand, I was definitely sad to see Margaery go. I always figured if she were to meet her end it would be at the hands of Cersei, but I thought there was going to be more to her story. Luckily, we still have a few Tyrell's laying around.At first, I was confused as to why we were getting any sort of Sand Snake/Dorne scene in the finale, but when I saw Lady Olenna Tyrell, it all started to make sense. It makes perfect sense that the Tyrell's and Sand's would combine their armies, with the help of Varys, alongside Dany's to take on the Lannister's. Is there really any question Dany will have no issue taking on the Lannister's army now? Some of the Ironborn, Dothraki, Unsullied, Tyrell's, Dorne, and let's not forget 3 dragons. Come on now.Mixed in with plenty of big momentum shifters were some small but important scenes with Sam at the Citadel and Arya checking someone off her list. The somewhat comedic scene where Sam discovers the library after struggling to get past the so called gatekeeper wasn't entirely necessary, but it was nonetheless cool to see the vastness of knowledge that place holds. However, the Arya scene was easily one of my favorite moments of the night. I was glad to see the Starks finally got some sort of redemption for the Red Wedding even if it was Arya taking her murderousness one step further.The next big Stark reveal came from another one of Bran's vision, as he finally got to see the conclusion of the Tower of Joy sequence. Not that Jon Snow's mother being Lyanna Stark came as a surprise to anyone, but it finally set those theories straight. Sure, we didn't get to hear all of what Lyanna said to Ned that day in the tower, but if the not-so-subtle transition from the baby to Snow's face meant anything, I think we have another Targaryen on the loose.Speaking of which, that brings me to the ever-so-satisfying second ""King of the North"" moment with the North finally embracing (and remembering) who the true leader of Winterfell is, and their name is Stark. It would have been nice for that moment to feature Sansa as well, especially after all she's been through, but both are deserving. I also shouldn't forget just how good that scene between Daavos, Melisandre, and Jon was. Well written, acted (particularly from Liam Cunningham), and directed. Seems like the theme of tonight.Of course, it's not a great Thrones episode without Tyrion, who now serves as the hand of the *Queen*. Or how about watching Maester Pycelle meet his deserved end. Or Cersei torturing Septa Unella AKA the same lady? Or even the look of disgust on the face of Jaime as he watched his beloved Cersei take the throne. This episode featured just about every major character from this show and gave them each a fitting end to their arcs this season. I honestly can't speak high enough about the direction from Miguel Sapochnik and writing from David and Dan. Even just looking at the flawless transitions from scene to scene deserve tons of credit. It will go down as one of my favorite episodes of the series thus far, and certainly most important.+Impeccable direction+Winter is here+Cersei goes mad+Arya checks Frey off her list+King of the North+Tyrell's and Sand's team up+Dany rides towards the throne+Daavos10/10"
437," My favorite scene in all of television
",10,True,The first 25 minutes of this episode was some of the best directed and written television I have ever scene. Absolutely chilling.
438," Fantastic!
",10,True,"Even though there is no fights and action scenes in this episode but it is indeed as good as The battle of The Bastards episode. firs of all : the music... God! the music is good probably the best thing in the episode it will get you hooked from the first second. The events unexpected and perfect and very well done and brings moments we've all been waiting for and we find out about either the most famous theory is right or not. The acting is great as usual. and what really makes this episode great that it's full of important events and prepares for a great next season and it closes a good season in a great way. Finally, this is how drama should be made. great drama with great dialogues and acting."
439," This is it, Game of Thrones is the best show humanity will ever create!!!!!
",10,True,"Just when you thought that the last episode ""Battle of the Bastards"" had all there is regarding those mind blowing twists, George R. R. Martin proved us all wrong. This episode has gotten me off my seat several times, and whenever I start to think that this is it and there will be no more surprises, I discover almost immediately that I could never be more wrong. This episode so far has a rating of 10/10 yet in my opinion it is still so frikin low. IMDb should implement a new rating system where we could give this show a 10000/10. I never really cared for writing a review before, but this show is just too much to keep to myself."
440," The best episode i have seen in my entire life
",10,True,"Perfect writing, perfect direction, perfect acting
What an episode!!!!"
441," So powerful it made watch the whole 6 series in one go.
",10,True,"For the longest time (close to 6 years), I managed to never watched one full episode of GoT. Everyone was always talking about it, but I knew I had to watch from season 1 episode 1 to give it any justice and I just never found time to watch all episodes from the beginning. And then that week happened.It was the week when HBO showed Season 6 Episode 10: Winds of Winter. I was channel surfing and coincidentally was on HBO on that very moment when the episode was starting. The intro music of GoT always sounded so interesting to me and this time I decided to watch the episode despite knowing almost zero about GoT.and I was awestruck. floored.It was breathtakingly beautiful and dramatic, and get this, I knew almost nothing about the characters.I was hooked. I was intrigued.And so the next week when I had so much free time, I binge watched all episodes from Season 1 episode 1 all the way to Winds of Winter.This doesn't even describe how hooked I was and how powerful is WoW to be able to force me to finally watch the whole show, something that I have postponed for almost 6 years. WoW is the single greatest episode in all of TV shows history. Not joking."
442," One of the most satisfying finales in television history
",10,True,"Following the widely acclaimed episode that preceded it, many assumed that the season's tenth and final episode would be somewhat subdued, tidying up lingering plot threads in preparation for what comes next. And yet, this could not be further from the truth.From the very beginning of the episode, it is immediately clear that something major is about to occur, indicated by the haunting sound of Ramin Djwadi's 'Light of the Seven', which introduces piano to the Game of Thrones score for the first time in what is arguably the most accomplished piece of music in the series. The ten-minute scene that ensues brings a rather meandering King's Landing plot to an explosive conclusion, building suspense and foreshadowing tragedy in a way that is nothing short of masterful.Meanwhile, somewhat quieter character arcs such as those of Arya, Jaime and Sam are concluded neatly, in scenes that are both shocking and satisfying in equal measure. Perhaps most importantly we are treated to a much anticipated reveal concerning the true parentage of Jon Snow, in a beautiful scene that contextualises Jon in the wider politics of Westeros as a key player and one that will no doubt present a challenge to Daenerys in future seasons.The final scenes of the episode present the new political landscape in the aftermath of monumentous events such as the Starks' reclaiming of Winterfell, the destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor and the defeat of the slave masters in Meereen. Namely, Jon is elected King in the North in a triumphant scene that parallels Robb's at the end of season one. However, the scene has an undercurrent of tension and foreboding, especially given that a less naive Game of Thrones audience remembers all too well the fate of the previous King in the North. In addition to this, Jon's accession to the Northern crown sidelines Sansa, arguably the more legitimate heir to Winterfell and the true winner of the Battle of the Bastards. Given that Littlefinger seems to be well aware of this fact, it seems as though the now united North is not yet free of plots and political intrigue that may lead to further divide.In King's Landing, Cersei is coronated as Queen of Westeros as a frightened audience looks on in terror. The moment is chilling, not least because Cersei has proven what she is capable of even when her power is dwindling, so the prospect of her becoming the most powerful woman in the kingdom is horrifying to say the least.And finally, Daenerys sets sail for Westeros. Occurring directly after Cersei's coronation, the scene serves to show the audience that there is indeed hope that Cersei's reign may not be a long one. Significantly, Daenerys' chapter in the east is concluded, bringing all of the show's major players into the same geographical landscape. There is a clear sense that the show is accelerating towards its ending and with only fifteen episodes remaining, it looks to be an eventful one.In summary, the Winds of Winter does an excellent job of tying up loose ends while simultaneously transforming the political sphere in a way the audience could not have expected. Supported by exceptional cinematography, typically stellar acting and an exquisite musical score, this episode provides a satisfying ending to the season. In many ways, it marks the end of an era all while whetting our appetite for what comes next."
443," The best episode in TV history
",10,True,"Phenomenal acting, directing, unforgettable emotional scenes make this episode the best episode in television history!"
444," Unexpected twists, like always
",10,True,"A lot of people didn't like the beginning of Season 6, they thought it was getting boring and bad but ""The Battle of the Bastards"" and ""Winds of Winter"" made this Season the best one yet. The acting (obviously) was amazing, the twist about the Sept of Baelor was very interesting I was just expecting a boring trial. What I loved was how the Directors managed to complete every characters story in this episode. The end of Season 5 was nothing but cliffhangers, does Sansa survive, what happens with Dorne after Myrcella, what happens to Dany, we haven't seen Bran in ages... But Season 6 finale completes all the character's stories and delivers an amazing season finale, can't wait for season 7 now..."
445," Best episode of anything ever
",10,True,"As long as you've been keeping track of this show since season 4 or 5, you will agree this is the best episode ever."
446," wow!
",10,True,"What a great journey this season has been. This is now turning into one of the greatest shows of all time, which after just the first two or three seasons, was hard for me to predict.I have not cast my vote on this show yet, i wait until it is done. Only then, i feel i can vote on this series. Where many TV series deliver a good or strong first season and receive a high vote, just to plummet later, and still keep their high scores. I just feel that on a TV show, the entire story needs to be told before i can finally deliver my own verdict.Because as i mentioned, many TV shows becomes increasingly worse over time, even TV shows with only a few seasons often do. But this is not the case with ""game of thrones"". This show has definitely had it's ups and downs, but what it does well is to keep on delivering strong scripts, strong performances, strong direction, strong CGI. Well it's strong in everything basically.I personally never thought this series could deliver drama to the level of ""The Wire"" or ""The Sopranos"" just to mention two. But however i always thought it would deliver a strong story that would intrigue and keep people on the edge of their seats, which it has done with flying colors, almost at the level of ""Breaking Bad"".When i saw the red wedding episode, i felt the same way do now. I have this sensation of WOW flowing through me. I have just witnessed something extraordinary. And then i feel like praising the people, the cast, the entire production for their outstanding craftsmanship. I'm simply in awe of this episode i just watched.The episode before this, ""The battle of the bastards"". Was a bit of a disappointment to me. I felt it was way to predictable and that to much happened in that episode alone to make me feel satisfied by the outcome. The episode was by no means bad, but i have come to set the bar pretty high when it comes to TV shows like this, and when i feel disappointed, the episode might still be a 8/10.But this episode however is one of the best episodes made in any TV show, of all time. I mean it. This is a masterpiece of an episode which manages to do everything right, i am absolutely blown away of what i just witnessed. And now i can't wait for the next season to begin, i better start eating my vitamins, i don't want to risk passing away before next spring. Come to think of it i should maybe stay inside and avoid using ladders and such as well.There is not much more to be said. There is no reason to say anything else. The episode simply is a 10/10 without any doubt. And not to jinx anything, but if the shows keeps this up, it will be a 10/10 as a whole as well. And that is seriously something i never expected.Now i need to go to the gym and start lowering my blood pressure."
447," The greatest season of all time
",10,True,"This season is by far the best season in the history of television series. I never thought there would be a season like Breaking Bad S5, but boy I was wrong. GOT is the GOAT."
448," Stunning
",10,True,"A review of this episode is incomplete without mentioning the musical score, it is perfect as it builds to a crescendo with the waiting, the fear, the arrogance, the anxiety and final realisation, it is the perfect match of audio visuals."
449," Like an extended ""previously on...""
",3,False,"Like an extended ""previously on..."" Before you get too offended by my rating, please understand I'm not someone who rates everything between a 5 and 10. I use the full scale and if it dips below a 5 it's because I didn't enjoy it. The show is still a high quality production.So where did it lose points from being average? Pretty much every scene just recapped something we already knew. Very little new information and very little forward momentum. When it does this it puts the characters in danger of becoming stale and predictable, and you suddenly realize that the premise set up six seasons ago - that the white walkers were about to attack from the north while the rest of the country fought among itself - is finally happening. Six seasons later. So long has it taken that they're all but finished fighting with only a few factions left. For a show that is known for surprises it's getting remarkably drawn out and predictable.I'm sure part of that is from finally running out material from the books to work from. And since that happened, the plot twists have become a little more predictable and familiar. Ever seen someone toast a group of people only to actually be poisoning them all? You may have if you watched Breaking Bad. Which also felt oddly referenced in the cleaning chamber pots montage. Overall I don't think either sequence worked.And Ed Sheeran? Really? That scene was flat out terrible. Forced dialogue, (""Are you old enough to drink?"" - I think pretty much anything goes in the world of Game of Thrones, so I'm not sure when they added a drinking age); pretty stilted acting; and as with many other scenes, not a lot of new information.I trust the show will pick up and the plot will get moving again, but you're pretty safe from spoilers when everything that happened was basically the completion of an action we saw started in the previous episode. Previously on Game of Thrones, watch someone get on a boat, this episode, see them get off it."
450," Arya the Unbelievable
",4,False,"I used to absolutely love the storyline of Arya Stark, her list and the hope of her one day crossing off the names on that list. While she is certainly doing that now (eg. Walder Frey), I find the way she is doing it is super unbelievable and rushed.Let's go back to last season where we saw in episode 8, Arya leaving Braavos to head back home. In a matter of 2 episodes, we see Arya already at the Twins killing Walder Frey. Not sure if many viewers know this but the Twins is on the west side of Westeros, meaning it would have taken a really long time for her to get there. Instead, we don't get to see any part of that journey so we are left to assume she got there unscathed. It all felt so rushed. Okay, I accepted that and moved on.Shift to this episode and right away, we see Arya murder a room full of Freys with poisoned wine. Okay, again, let's assume she was able to poison the wine without getting noticed or running into any trouble while doing so. Now she's left the Twins and is making her way down to King's Landing to kill Cersei? Surely, she would have caught wind somewhere that Jon and Sansa had retaken Winterfell since everyone else knows but instead she's unaware and is heading south. She runs into a group of Lannister men and again, nobody touches her! I'm sorry, but in the world of George RR Martin, Lannister men are not good men. They would have wasted little time seizing her, questioning her, and probably attempting to rape her. The country is still at war. How does a teenage girl riding alone with a sword not look suspicious? I don't believe this moment for a second. But I guess since Ed Sheeran was with them, there wasn't a bad bone in their bodies...In the first 5 seasons, character's actions always had consequences and that is what made the show so great. Our favourite characters would get killed because of stupid mistakes (Ned Stark, Robb Stark). Even when the hated characters were killed, we were never fully satisfied. Joffrey died but Tyrion was imprisoned. Arya killed Meryn Trant but got her eyesight taken away. We may yet see Arya pay the consequences for these actions but right now, it is too easy for her. I don't believe she is a highly skilled assassin. She failed at the 2 assassinations she was assigned in Braavos and all we saw her get good at was fighting with a bow staff. Somehow, she is invincible right now.I hope George RR Martin finished his books soon so we can really see what happens with Arya Stark."
451," A Topsy - turvy start
",7,False,"I was eagerly waiting for Game of Thrones to return ever since Cersei blew up the Sept and Danaerys set sail to Westeros in Season 6 Finale. But does this episode live up to this hype? The answer is not a strict yes or no. Instead, this premiere marked a Topsy - turvy start to the season. Although nothing eventful happens in season premieres, but considering the reduced episode count for this season, this premiere should have been action packed. It had its moments - humour, revenge, remorse but the narrative momentum never attained a desirable pace. The starting sequence of Arya's revenge increased the hype manifold and as soon as the opening theme started, I couldn't wait anymore. But again, the episode didn't really take off. The scenes at King's landing - Cersei and Jaime realizing their odds in the war to come, Euron Greyjoy's entry and his proposal to Cersie - were well enacted and laid a foundation to an alliance to be witnessed in the war. Things started going downhill when Euron left promising to return with a ""gift"" (This was really predictable). Then we see Sam cleaning ""pots"", having weird meals, sorting books and weighing organs. The editing in this part was on point and prevented the scene from seeming out of place. I, honestly, would be happy if Sam did not return for further scenes in the same episode. But, nah. Another scene where Sam gets ""access"" to the restricted area in the library and him finding out important information about dragon-glass, seemed rushed and I think, was not necessary to be shown in the premiere. Maybe this would have been more appropriate in the next episode?! Also, Jorah Mormont is at the Citadel locked in a room. He extends his arm out of a small window just to ask if Dany has reached Westeros. This was weird and honestly, disappointing. Also, there is a rather long sequence of Hound with BWB (Brotherhood without banners) where they find a suitable place to rest for the chilly night. The sequence was really long (about 10 minutes long) where certain things happened (all of which, IMO, has little to no impact on the overall story). It seemed rather unnecessary and just for the sake of giving a certain depth to Hound's character but there is just not enough time (and need) for this.Also, Ed Sheeran's cameo scene is strangely humorous and weird and feels out of place. It is also uncomfortably long and feels rather forced. The last six minutes are devoted to Danaerys and her allies arriving at Dragonstone. Emilia Clarke had one dialogue throughout the scene but she was supposed to (at least) show some emotion as she arrived at her ancestral home. Like, why is she so expressionless?The biggest complaint I have with this episode is its editing. Why didn't they edit some unnecessary long sequences to accommodate sequences of other characters who weren't shown in the premiere at all (Melisandre, Olena Tyrell, Sand Snakes, even Bran and Meera were just shown arriving at Castle Black). A huge chunk of time was devoted to Sam, Arya and Hound & BWB. A crisp editing would have enabled about 15 minutes to spare on other characters as well which were absent. Even Jon is given a mere 5 minutes of screen time but he shines (as always). A brief argument (disagreement?) between him and Sansa and littlefinger's smirk really set up the political disturbance yet to be experienced at Winterfell. Tyrion Lannister (one of the most important characters) had (close to) no screen time, no dialogues. Another problem is that this episode was largely predictable and nothing (big) actually happened. So all in all, it was a largely average episode (bad, considering the standards set by the series) which had its moments. But that's it. A large portion of it was some unnecessary stuff which nobody really cares about."
452," Shall We Begin?
",8,True,"Well, the longest wait in between seasons is finally over. Winter is here and Game of Thrones has returned. Much like most of the season premieres, 'Dragonstone' dealt with a lot of aftermath to last season's events, and a whole lot of set-up for this season. The one thing that separates this season from most is that it seems like the majority of the characters are actually beginning to realize the bigger threat at hand. That is, besides Cersei and Daenerys, they haven't gotten there just yet.Ironically, that's part of what really excites me about this season, though. The inevitable battle for Westeros and battle of wit between Daenerys and Cersei, and how everyone else deals with the army of the dead. Nearly half of the scenes mentioned the Night King or his army in some way shape or form. Of course, Cersei chooses not to associate herself with any of that, even going as far as mentioning every other threat in Westeros besides the white walkers. However, her scene with Jaime was just as interesting anyway. You can tell how torn and worried Jaime is. You can only hope the best for him, even after everything he's been through. And what might this gift be that Euron is offering to give Cersei? It's hard to think of anything she'd want more than Tyrion's head at this point, but I hardly believe that will be the outcome. Instead, I think it will be something or someone we haven't seen in quite some time. I tend to believe that Gendry Baratheon theory the more and more I think about it.In the North, we had a few important but predictable things happen. We had heard that there would still be some (unnecessary) tension between Sansa and Jon, well that was definitely the case. Isn't it about time Sansa trusts Jon's way of things? I get it, she's trying to warn Jon about being too honorable, something that got Robb and Ned killed. But there's something to be said for 2 family members on this show not arguing their way to an unpleasant death, am I right? Elsewhere at The Wall, Bran and Meera were let in after convincing Ed that he's the three-eyed raven and he knows everything. How long until Jon meets back up with Bran?Speaking of Starks, perhaps the person with the most memorable moments of the episode was Arya's 'Red Wedding Redemption' at Riverrun. I can't believe I'm saying this, but if it took spending 2 seasons at The House of Black and White for Arya to produce great scene after great scene, then I think it was all worth it. A reverse Red Wedding was exactly the cold open we needed, once again proving that George RR Martin can be good to the Starks after all. I was a little bit surprised to not see her immediately kill those Lannister soldier's, but I guess it was done to show us that there's still a little bit left of innocent Arya in her.There was a lot of Sam in this episode, perhaps too much. Check that, there was definitely too much screen time for Sam. It's not that I don't like his character, but I just don't see the reason behind wasting valuable time on something that could be sped by in a minute or two. He may have found the key to defeating the white walkers, and we found out Jorah isn't doing so well and spending time at the Citadel being partially taken care of by Sam himself. Cool to see Jorah, but man those scenes with Sam were crappy (for the most part). But, Seriously though.The last few bits included The Hound finding his way back to the house him and Arya stayed in a few seasons back, and Daenerys finding her way home. Both very different 'homecomings', but both very emotionally resonant scenes nonetheless. There isn't necessarily a parallel to be drawn between the two, but it's very interesting to think about how far those 2 characters in particular have come since the opening episode of the series. I love seeing The Hound in a different light, one that's less bloody and far more forgiving, and Daenerys is certainly at her most powerful after reaching her home. And that was about it for a first episode. Certainly an impressive opening, albeit not as surprising as last year's Melisandre shocker. It's annoying to think we only have 6 more weeks of this, but it will have to do for now. I'm 100% sure that the rest of the season will be top-quality Thrones.+Recap & set-up+Daenerys reaches home+Jaime is torn+Arya's redemption+The Hound's transformation-Sam cleaning up crap8.3/10"

454," More of the path started in season 5
",6,False,"I loved the show till the end of fourth season. Since then it's good, but not great with just a few great scenes, for example what happened in Hardhome. This premiere episode is more of the same since season 5. The time flies, the writers don't really care about details. For example: in season six when the greyjoys left with no ship show up with a fleet made on the iron island with no freaking trees there. But it's okay, because GoT handles things like that. It's the writing and dialogues I don't really like or not convinced of. When Euron Greyjoy dealing with Cersei don't come up with a strong hand, like saying ""you have a lot of enemies, but no allies, what do you offer"" If you want to have a strong ally you must offer yourself something. Instead Euron have to convince Cersei of his loyalty, well, too simple. So she is the big fish and sets the terms, right? But she doesn't have a fleet and she will need one against her enemies. Just saying. Also I don't get her motivation when Jamie asked her why they are doing this. It's reduced to power. That's a little too simple. Of course it's about power but how to get there? You need allies, you need deception, some matchplan for your goal, look how real geopolitics works. Instead we see King's landing reduced to Jamie and Cersei having their problems. I don't see a build up for smart moves or any power on the side of the Lannisters. All gone with Tywin. I just wanted to give you an impression where I see some problems of the once great and now just mediocre series."

Without spoiling the fun, ""Dragonstone"" doesn't just pick up where ""Winds of Winter"" left off, it amps up the intensity and brings a promise of another great season of GoT.Most of our favorites get plenty of airtime, difficult considering the breadth of the series. As befitting a season premiere, we're given some surprising twists, reintroduced to some we've missed, and left ready for the next episode. In between, time flies... although the dragons wait a bit before appearing. But when they do appear, the title becomes both appropriate and poignant. The lack of deep dialogue provides a perfect background for the setting.Couple of tips - wait for that snack, make sure you watch from the start (before the credits) until the end. Pay attention to small talk and detail, and remember that we're off the books now... for the most part, DB and DW have the reins with GRRM providing oversight!Waiting for ""Stormborn""..."
456," Wow.. what an amazing premier episode
",10,True,"Just out of this world awesome, has to be the best season premier of any show ever. Every second of this one hour episode was pure gold, everything from the writing, to the amazing acting, directing and effects.HBO has done it again, this is the reason why Game of Thrones is the greatest show that has ever been. I have to also praise the score by Ramin Djawadi.All and all, this episode made it official, that Game of Thrones is way way better than the books it's based on. Sorry George, but sometimes adaptations are just better. And this is one of those times."
457," Shall we not?
",5,False,"Arguably, I should have stopped watching the show two years ago, but peer pressure keeps me going - and to be honest, I do enjoy bashing it. Nonetheless, I try to be as fair in my judgment as my disappointment with its course can allow.Which is why I can and will recognise there were a few good things in this seventh season premiere. Sandor is the one character I still very much enjoy, and his scenes were probably the highlight of the episode. Sam's adventures in Oldtown were also interesting, despite two alarming signals: 1) I know teleportation is by now the standard method of travel in the series, but how did Jorah end up there? 2) dragonglass mine in Dragonstone - have to tell Jon - precursor of meeting that will make me throw up, argh. Meanwhile, in King's Landing, after reinforcing the view that Cersei has simply become a completely different character for no justifiable reason (going from ""lioness protecting her cubs"" to ""meh, never cared for these brats anyway"" is not a shift that can be excused by any trauma or whatnot, it's simply terrible storytelling), we see that Jaime doesn't seem to care all that much that all his children are dead either. I mean, he cared when Joffrey died despite recognising he's a monster, but who cares about losing the good kids, right? Other than that, the alliance with Euron is, I will cede, a sensible move, but Euron's portrayal remains poor - don't know if it's due to him being completely unlike the book version or because he does, as I read somewhere, seem to be a copy of Vikings' Floki, but he's very meh.Elsewhere, Arya's adventures in the Marvel Universe continue, as the show treats her as some kind of Westerosi Mystique. The opening scene was supposed to be some sort of reverse Red Wedding to provide closure, but it was so sloppy, uninteresting and naive, derivative to the point that it seemed like they just wanted to get it over with quickly - now that I think about it, the scene's lack of quality does make it the reverse of the Red Wedding. In her other appearance, Arya meets a group of laughably kind-hearted Lannister soldiers, put there to tell the audience in huge, simple font, that ""people who fight for the Lannisters are not necessarily bad guys"". Because, and that is the crux of the show's faltering course, more and more it becomes a show of good and bad guys, when the absence of such clear dualism is the story's most interesting quality, plot- wise.Up to the North, Brandon and Meera reach the Wall but we are never told how they survived - Hodor held the door, but not for that long and they weren't 10 minutes away. Well. Not as bad as escaping by ship and ending up on the wrong side of the Wall at the exact middle of the continent, but unless I am forgetting a scene from last season, inexplicable. At Castle Black, Jon makes some decisions which are better than Sansa's ideas, but it's still pretty silly to see how half the most important Houses of the region are all in the hands of toddlers. The intricacy of how many loyal Umbers and even Karstarks remain is lost in the series which appears to recognise at most two heirs at each House, but this simplification is understandable so I won't hold it against them. I will say I have begun to find the little Mormont girl annoying, but that's probably due to me needing things to annoy me in the show.And speaking of annoying things, we reach the end, where Annoying McStupidface Daenerys has the nerves to set foot on Dragonstone (completely empty because...I don't know) and take down Stannis' banner with that smug, irritating ""they took my burger"" look, while her troupe of suddenly braindead advisers stare with awe at her. Because gods forbid that they end an episode without centering around her Uselessness.On the plus side, we didn't have to suffer through any Sand Snakes dialogue."
458," A solid start to season seven
",8,True,"This episode largely serves to remind viewers where each of the protagonists are and where they hope to go. In the opening scene we see that Arya's revenge against the Freys didn't end with the killing of Walder. Meanwhile her brother Brandon reaches The Wall, warning of the approaching threat while their siblings Jon and Sansa disagree on how to proceed after the defeat on Ramsey Bolton and his forces. Back in King's Landing Cersei, now the Queen, is seeking new allies for the coming fight against Daenerys's forces as well as against the Armies of the North and the Sand Sisters to the south. Elsewhere Sam is trying to find a source of dragon glass and Daenerys finally returns to Westeros.I really enjoyed this episode; it started well with Arya making it abundantly clear that she has lots of people to kill. It then proceeds to remind us what other characters are up to while setting things up for future episodes. The tension between Sansa and Jon hints at possible problems to come and the meeting between Cersei and Euron Greyjoy suggests the possibility of an interesting alliance. Apart from the opening scene there is little in the way of violence; even that involved poison rather than action; that didn't bother me though as the more talky elements served to remind me of the various characters after some time away from the series. I know some people weren't keen with having singer Ed Sheeran appear as a Lannister soldier but it didn't bother me; if I hadn't heard about his appearance before watching I doubt I'd have thought anything of it. As expected the cast are all on fine form and the effects are impressive. Overall a long season opener that immediately brought me back into the story after a gap of almost two years."
459," A terrific start to the seventh season
",9,True,"After being impressed by how impressive the sixth season of Game of Thrones was when it continued the character arcs for the surviving Stark and Lannister family members and the writing was as strong as the previous five seasons (despite one episode in season 5 that I considered to be my least favorite, Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken even though it was decent). Anyway, when I saw the first episode of the seventh season last summer in order to catch up with the series finale coming in 2019, it lived up to my expectations and it became a great start. The reason why I'm giving this a 9/10 is because the only quibble that I have with Dragonstone is that while it was great to see Ed Sheeran and the other song artists Will Champion, the drummer from Coldplay and Gary Lightbody from Snow Patrol playing Lannister soldiers and sharing a scene with Maisie Williams, they only appeared for four minutes. I mean, after they sang that song together, I was expecting them to have more screen time in the seventh season, but sadly, they didn't. What a shame.Anyway, the rest of the episode is solid. The storyline continues to be exquisite much like the previous six seasons and continues to up the ante with the relationships. Not only that, there are some great scenes that made it worthwhile to other viewers. Arya disguising herself as Walder Frey and having her revenge on the House of Frey for killing her mother Catelyn Stark and her brother Robb Stark by killing them, Sandor Clegane, who survived his wounds after the fourth and sixth seasons and having to atone for his old life of working with the House of Lannister, and Daenerys's dramatic homecoming to Dragonstone. Those sequences are amazing and another perfect example of well-paced and atmospheric filming which makes them on par with The Red Wedding, the Execution of Eddard Stark, the destruction of the Great Sept, and more. Ramin Djawadi continues to create more excellent music for his score for this season. It fitted the scenes really well as well as retaining the scale and scope of the production designs, which are still as gorgeous and before. The editing is sharp, the pacing didn't drag, and the acting continues to be strong with the best coming from Maisie Williams, Kit Harrington, Sophie Turner, and Emilia Clarke.Overall, Dragonstone delivered what it promised. It showed the characters trying to make an army to they can begin the war against the White Walkers while continuing the depth and development. This deserves a thumbs up from me. :)"
460," Decent but not up to the hype
",7,False,"Premiere episodes are never groundbreaking, we all know that. But given the fact that the seasons are shorter now (even though it's a long winter!), one expects them to tell something we don't already know. Let's see one by one from best to worst:1. Arya's scenes were applaud worthy. The transition from Recap to Prologue of the season was so smooth that for a moment I thought they were showing a flashback sequence. The dialogues were sharp and the characterisation smooth. Her bit with Ed Sheeran was well shot too. There was an attempt to show the other side of Lannister army. Not all Lannisters men are like the Mountain. 2. Jon-Sansa-Baelish scenes follow close. One gets a deeper insight into the budding troubles in their relationship. Jon could very well meet the same fate as his uncle, aunt and cousin and he did very well meet it at the end of season 5, all because he lacks the shrewdness and authoritative attitude that is needed to be a ruler. But he has Sansa to teach him that, only if he listens. The scene is well written and well shot. Baelish is creeping his finger little by little into Sansa's mind. Let's hope she doesn't disappoint. 3. Samwell's scenes, as usual, were a catalyst to move the story forward and propel the story towards the long awaited albeit inevitable Jon-Dany union. The attempt to showcase how routine and dull his life is and how he has fewer friends here, despite being amongst his kind was nice, but nothing we haven't already seen before.4. The Hound and the Brotherhood scenes were way too stretched and whatever impact that they were aiming at was lost because of this. From killing a man who hosted him well when he was hungry in season 4 to burying the dead innocent people who died of winter, Hound shows a spectrum here. 5. Cersei-Jaime scenes were predictable by far. Jaime's reaction may have been disappointing for some but I had stated multiple times before that he was on the darker side of grey. The fact that he couldn't as much as be angry at Cersei for doing something for which he killed Aerys Targaryen shows his fickle nature. Ned Stark was right. He serves people well, when serving is easy. The fangirls might as well calm down now. Cersei-Euron story line seems stretched and probably exists just so that there can be a fair war. But I am ready for a surprise here because you can clearly see an evilness in Euron's eyes. 6. Daenerys' scene was the worst in the whole episode. One would think that after a wait of 6 seasons, they would start her off with a bang right from the premiere episode of season 7, but they disappointed. Hopefully, the next episode onward she will have good matter. It looks like they are solely delaying her story line so that they get time to bind other plots together. I was disappointed to see the Baratheon stag on King's Landing in the opening theme, even though she had been proclaimed as the Protector of the Realm as Cersei of House Lannister at the end of season 6. Overall, it is a decent premiere building up for the rest of the season and the pace might hopefully go uphill next episode onward. 7/10."
461," Is that it?
",4,False,"I was probably expecting too much. I have spent such a long time waiting for this and the last 2 episodes of season 6 were incredible. I rated this a 4 because the current score is 9.4. I wanted to help lower peoples expectations a bit. Also, I mean a 4 by GOT standards which would be like an 8 for any other show. My main problem was that barely anything actually happened. The best moment of the episode is at the very beginning. Before the title sequence even. Everything else was just so long and drawn out. They could have easily covered all of this in half the time. There is a scene between Arya and some random soldiers. It takes at least 5 mins and it seems like its only purpose is to give Ed Sheeran a cameo. There is another scene with the Hound that goes on way too long. I love this show so much, but, things are not off to a good start. Tyrion didn't even say one word this episode. With only 7 episodes this season I was hoping for twice as much action in half the time, not half as much action in twice the time. Get it together GOT. This could be the greatest TV show of all time. To let it all fall apart in the final season would be tragic."
462," Don't let the hype fool you
",7,False,"If ""Hardhome"" is a 10/10, then ""Dragonstone"" is a 7/10 at best. There's no formula for predicting the arch of a season of Game of Thrones (other than the 9th episode will always be the most eventful), so for that reason, every episode should be looked at objectively. While many would argue that the purpose of ""Dragonstone"" was simply to set up the rest of the season, I would argue that the only new information we got was that; 1) Sandor Clegane is capable of feeling guilt, and 2) Euron Greyjoy intends to seduce Cersei Lannister. Every other scene in the episode is a repackaged version of information that we've already been given.We all knew that Daenerys was headed for Westeros. We all knew that the white walkers were headed for the wall. Arya had already killed Walder Frey using the face of another man, so why do we care if she uses the same trick to kill all of his minions?The success of Game of Thrones has come from the showrunners and writers unparalleled ability to constantly feed us new information. I expect the show to return to form sooner rather than later, but this episode felt unnecessary."
463," Uneventful
",5,False,"The entire episode consisted of exposition and useless dialogue where characters are restating the obvious/what the audience knows. There was very little conflict, and Sansa's/ Jon's disagreement felt very contrived to say the least. The dialogue is also not what it used to be. You could cut 40 minutes out of the episode, and it would make little to no impact to future events. I am truly astounded that the episode earned a 9.4 at the time of this review."
464," A great start!
",9,True,"All in all, the season 7 premier was a great start! Great visuals, good plot advancement and good quality sounds.My only issue was the Ed Sheeran cameo. Was incredibly forced, and is not needed in a show like this, especially when he got more lines than the main characters! The 5 minute scene was not needed and could have been used elsewhere.Regardless, when looking over that scene, it was a good strong start the the season. It did not disappoint."
465," Deceptive Episode
",7,False,"After more than one year waiting for ""Game of Thrones"" (the last episode was on 26 Jun 2016) and the beginning of a seven-episode season, the slow-paced ""Dragonstone"" is deceptive. With the exception of Arya's revenge and Samwell's discovery of the ""dragonstones"", the rest of the episode is boring and practically pointless going nowhere. Anyway the expectation of watching ""Game of Thrones"" gathering family and friends was worthwhile. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Dragonstone"""
466," It's still got it!
",9,True,"Game of Thrones is finally on its seventh season now. And we finally have the endgame in sight for the story. This episode does admittedly fall short of the previous two OUTSTANDING episodes from season six, but we still want to see where Daenerys, Tyrion, Jon Snow and The Hound end up by the time the story is all wrapped-up come season eight.This was a good episode to start on, but I'm mighty curious to see where this will all go to. Will Tyrion survive? Will Daenerys actually take back her long-lost home of Kings Landing? And will The Hound confront his brother The Mountain? I hope the latter happens; that will be a fight to remember.Anyway, Game of Thrones is still on the air and still leaving an impact on us."
467," A perfect build up
",9,True,"A very good premiere especially in the begging when Arya poisoned the Freys!! Excellent acting, scenery, effects all perfect. For those who disagree it was the 1st episode of course we wont see any huge mind-blow event until the last episodes..The scene when Khaleeshi step foot on Dragonstone was such a touching moment!! Cersei baddest bitch of all i wait more from her and we will see lots of destruction caused by her! Let's begin!"
468," Ruined by fan-service
",1,False,"It all started off so well.Picking up the trail from the tantalising end to series 6, the momentum and high-stakes (mostly) preserved, around the 40 minute mark I found myself being suddenly jolted back into reality.I don't typically care much for pop culture, GoT is an exception as it provides a form of private escapism, but I'm reluctant to remember that by this stage in the show's original run it had garnered a significant base of ""fan girls"".Unfortunately this demographic is pandered to in this episode when, halfway through the episode, no one other than ginger pug-faced crooner Ed Sheeran suddenly appears as a Lannister solider extra.I can't begin to emphasise how DISTRACTING this scene was. His interaction with Arya felt entirely forced and artificial, and the acting was as wooden as the hilt on his prop sword. It honestly felt like a comic relief sketch, I was embarrassed for them (it also certainly didn't help throwing Thomas Turgoose into the mix, who is seemingly only capable of portraying Northern chavs).1-star might seem harsh, but this honestly ruined the episode for me, like the 4th wall was for a moment broken and the sacred canon was compromised and spilled out into the real-world.It was a terrible, PR-driven, decision to include this cameo, and undermined (and potentially damaged) the IP as a whole. I would say, let's hope it moves on to better things, but knowing what we know now about S8, it doesn't look like that is to be.."
469," Great Season Premire
",9,True,"Season 7, episode 1. The Hound and Beric Dondarrion are aligned - both wonder why they are still alive, Beric talks Hound into looking into the fire to see what he can see. Cersei is trying to find allies - Jaime is there to help her. Arya pays a visit to all the Freys to remind them ""The North Remembers"". Daenerys, Tyrion and their fleet arrive in Westeros. Sam and Gilly are adapting to their new life in Oldtown - Sam discovers a Stannis must have been correct. The Night King is making his way south. 9/10"
470," Excellent start of a new season
",10,True,"This is how 1st episode of new season of a series should start .It is without drag ,it didn't divert from the plot and no unnecessary scenes in this episode.Perfect start for a new season of Game of Thrones and this is what viewers and a Game of thrones fan would expect, a perfect start ."
471," Pure Gold!
",10,True,"(spoiler)I've waited so long for this, was afraid I would get disappointed, and I must admit that I was a bit disappointed at the beginning of the episode, thinking it would just drag the story and lose 15 min on recap, not seeing what was about to happen. Overall I loved every second of it, especially the humor that was thrown every here and there, like the scenes with Euron and Sam. However, even though I rate the pilot 10, I must say that it felt way too short for a season premiere and I feel like there's so little I've learned besides what was already hinted by the 2 trailers and from episode description. Looking forward for second episode, hoping it will bring more action and somehow will pass the expectations hinted by the trailers."
472," Disappointing Premiere
",7,False,"I love Game of Thrones, I've been watching the Series ever since Season1 and long before it has been hyped all over the globe. I really looked forward to Season 7 and I was a bit surprised when I read that they did cut the amount of Episodes for the last two Seasons.Thats why I expected the Episodes to be paced a bit faster in order to fit in all the missing pieces. However, Episode 1 was far from fast-paced and it did not really develop the plot any further to be honest. It starts really promising, with a scene that got me feel chills in my spine and than it somehow falls into a list of dialogue sequences in most plot-areas, the dialogue content was overall not really important. We even see a (rather long) cameo from a real-life musician that seemed extremely odd and immersion- breaking. The Episode started to generate a bit of tension in the last few minutes, but overall it was pretty boring and I hate to say that...I can't really give this one more than a 7 and that's only because of the good start of the Episode. I really hope that the future Episodes will add more tension to the plot and we actually see some things happening. There aren't a lot of Episodes left to tell the tale.Regards, David."
473," The Prince(ss) Who Was Promised
",9,True,"As a longtime fan, there's perhaps nothing more cool than hearing Daenerys and Jon Snow talk about each other. Of course, next week that excitement will likely be amplified when they do meet, but there's something so satisfying about a little bit of dialogue from both sides about each other. The best part about it is that the meeting actually makes a ton of sense logistically. It's not like the show is forcing the meeting for the heck of it to improve ratings, Jon & Daenerys are a combination people have been wanting for years, and the showrunners waited for just the right time. Luckily, that wasn't the only great development this week.After being so set on going to King's Landing to kill Cersei, Arya had a change of heart tonight and decided to head back home to Winterfell. It's weird to think that she had no idea what was going on in the North and Jon Snow's victory at the Battle of the Bastards. Her reunion with Hot Pie was a really nice moment because they haven't seen each other in years, but mostly because of Maisie Williams' performance. She barely had to say any words to know exactly how she felt when hearing her brother Jon took back the North. Can't wait to see her head back to her home and *fingers crossed* actually see Jon and Sansa. We all know this show has a frustrating history of ripping the rug out from under us more than once. Coupling those scenes with Arya's bittersweet reunion with Nymeria, and Maisie had one heck of a week. Again, it's not like this show just threw in that scene to excite fans, it makes sense thematically with what Arya is going through. Nymeria naturally won't go with Arya because she has already found her home with other wolves, just like Arya returning to her home in Winterfell because that's where she belongs.Back to the Jon & Daenerys front, it really seems like both are struggling with the power hierarchy in their respected circles. On one hand, Dany's discussion at Dragonstone with Yara, Varys, Tyrion, Olenna, Ellaria, and others, shows just how far she still is from conquering. Though, if she follows what Olenna said, perhaps that conquering will be sooner than expected. Jon is dealing with some tough feedback from his North men and women as well. Ultimately though, he made his decision to head to Dragonstone and leave Winterfell with Sansa. Will this lead to Sansa getting rid of Littlefinger once and for all? Or perhaps more likely, give Littlefinger the wiggle room to manipulate Sansa one last time.There wasn't a ton of Cersei material this week, but she did apparently figure out a way to ""kill"" a dragon. The dragon size crossbow is interesting, but sure isn't as shocking as the wildfire she brought out last year. Not that it wasn't a possibility already, but I have to believe one of the dragons will fall by season's end. The playing field has to be leveled a little bit, right? Well, I guess it already was by having Euron take down a bunch of Greyjoy ships, the sand snakes, and capture Ellaria. Boy was it depressing to see Theon once again fail under pressure as it becomes all the more likely Yara won't make it out of this season alive.Some other tidbits worth mentioning; Jorah's health is looking better! I don't like spending time at the Citadel, it's become pretty annoying at this point. But if Sam cures Jorah, I'll be a happy man. Jon pinning Littlefinger up against the wall was awesome. It sure doesn't look like Jaime will be switching sides (like I hoped) anytime soon. I really hate seeing Jon & Dany constantly being undermined. This may be the first episode where every scene essentially boiled down to the same conflict. No fillers this year. Finally, hearing Dany say ""He sounds like quite a man"" about Jon Snow, pretty much rattled every bone in my body. So many thoughts. The Prince Who Was Promised prophecy finally taking shape!+Dany & Jon parallels+Surprised by the Euron battle+Arya's decision/reunions+So much progression, no filler scenes9.2/10"
474," Inconsistency hurting the series...
",6,False,"Firstly, it's an OK episode. However, I really feel there's been a drop off in story quality since Old Fatty Martin handed over the plot to the HBO guys. There seems to be an inconsistency in the characters - Arya is tough as nails in one episode and sloppy and sentimental in this one. Theon is regaining himself in one episode and totally pooping the bed in this one. Jon realizes his duty to the north and the importance of saving Sansa in one episode,in this episode he's set to go gallivanting off to see Daenyrs and painting a target on Sansa with his bizarrely out of character treatment of Littlefinger. The ladies from Dorne are tough and their poison blades stop everyone last season, in this episode Euron gets hit with the poison daggers and whips about a dozen times with no effect. The biggest gaffe is having Yara be the tough sea captain and get totally caught off guard by Euron. He seems to know where she would be, and when, and also know her whole fleet wouldn't have any lookouts! He also seemed to sail into the middle of her fleet all at once (if you've ever sailed you know how super bogus this plot device is) and shoot her ships with guided rockets that miss his boats (which were boarding her whole fleet at the same time!!!). I know the HBO writers need to advance the plot, and Old Fatty Martin is probably going to pull a Robert Jordan and leave them in a bind, but the inconsistent characters and the way Euron magically beat Yara (and also happened to board her ship, out of the whole armada) with magic rockets and stealth boats is a bit (extremely) ridiculous."
475," A Breathtaking Second Episode
",10,True,"After starting off the season with a formidable premiere possessing some of the best dialogue in recent seasons, Stormborn proves to be even stronger than its predecessor and finishes composing the beginning of what appears to be the biggest season yet. Daenerys' scene at the very beginning of the episode acted as a breath of fresh air. We finally witness the counsel of the Dragon Queen enlighten her with the fact that the players of the game must be capricious by nature in order to adapt to the ever changing politics of Westeros. Varys' speech added multiple layers of depth to his character, as previously his motives remained ambiguous. Now everyone understands what he refers to as ""the realm"", which is those who live without a political voice. Daenerys' scene with Melisandre was also monumental in terms of plot development, as it is the orchestrator for Daenerys' first meeting with Jon in the next episode.Jon's scenes were strong as always. He faces some internal conflict amongst his northern vassals regarding whether or not to venture towards Dragonstone, especially given the family history between the Starks and the Targaryens. However, he resolves this in a kingly fashion and cements his position of authority over his men, something Robb had much difficulty with following his inheriting of the North. His scene with Littlefinger, while brief, demonstrated his Targaryen passion along with his loyalty towards his family, qualitative characteristics of a Stark.Arya's storyline has returned to the spotlight, as every scene she takes part in has absolutely shone in season 7. Her scene with Hot Pie is demonstrative of how far she has come along on her journey, and the characterization and development she has undergone. When comparing this Arya to the one who roamed around the Riverlands with Hot Pie, the contrast is easily discernible. Her reunion with Nymeria, along with her reaction to the Red Wedding, is one of the most heart touching moments in her storyline so far.Finally, although having a rocky start, the scene with the Ironborn and Dornishmen was the absolute pinnacle of ""Stormborn."" Although tremendously interesting families, the adventures of the Greyjoys and Martells were previously poorly adapted for television when held in comparison to their book counterparts. However, the battle on the narrow sea was easily the greatest scene that both families have ever been involved in, and rivals the likes of The Tower of Joy and Oberyn vs. The Mountain as one of the greatest short action sequences Game of Thrones has ever produced. The Ironborn reaving culture was on full display, and the Martells...made for suitable victims. My highest praise has to go to the portrayal of Euron Greyjoy. There is a stark contrast between his season 6 and season 7 depictions. Joffrey and Ramsay were villains that I loved to hate, but Euron Greyjoy has developed such a sense of personality that I absolutely love his character, and stands alongside Cersei and Littlefinger as one of my absolute favorite villains. Episode three looks to be just as good, or perhaps even better. A stupendous start to the season so far. An interesting blend between Season 4's outstanding storytelling and Season 6's colossal plot points."
476," A Very Solid Second Episode
",10,True,"Whereas I felt the premiere did decently well to kickoff each storyline it was missing concrete events and the action that comes with it. With this being a shorter season than we're accustomed to, we should expect the plot to move quicker and be more action packed. And this episode definitely delivered on the conflicts that were promised. When was the last time we had a battle in the second episode of the season? Wow! Euron sabotaging his niece and nephew's plans was the highlight of a very strong episode in my opinion. The skirmish was like Pirates of the Caribbean: Game of Thrones edition, well choreographed and executed. Although he is without a doubt just a madman pirate captain, I found myself rooting for Euron just so those annoying Sand Snakes and their corny dialogue could finally be wiped out. The show may have failed Stannis and some other book characters, but its definitely giving Euron the justice he deserves as the merciless savage that he is made out to be. As for Theon's breakdown at the end, it just goes to show that he is still a broken man inside and I really don't know what he has left to offer the show after this episode.The other story lines moved well in my opinion. Almost every scene featured a conflict of some sort, whether it was between two parties or internal (as in Arya's case).Danaerys's exchange with Varys and later Olenna did well to show how her vision compares to the experiences of older, more experienced ""schemers."" In King's Landing, Randyll Tarly commanded respect even in the presence of Cersei and Jaime, the later of whom tried to convince him to join their side. I'm sure he will fight for the Lannisters but we'll just have to wait and see. In Winterfell, the scene where Jon tried to convince the other lords that allying with Danaerys is good for them was also well done. Once again, Jon is faced with a difficult decision that everyone else opposes but he always chooses to do what'll be right in the end. The scene between him and Littlefinger was also a good touch as it shows Jon just perceives Littefinger as a creep after Sansa and nearly chokes him to death (just like Ned did in season 1). What Littlefinger does next I'm curious to see. The Arya scenes I feel were also well done and seeing her reunite with Hot Pie, albeit for only a few minutes, was pretty cool. She now seems very conflicted about her intentions, as anyone would be in her position. The wolf scene was also a good touch although I hope its not the last time we see Nymeria (if it really was her). The dynamic between Sam and Jorah was also compelling except Sam should have brought Jorah more rum before attempting to tear his entire outer layer of skin off. The only scene I though was unnecessary was the intimate one between Grey Worm and Missandei. We get it, they've got a thing for each other, but do we really need to see the start of what would have been a dickless sex scene? It just seemed like that part dragged out too long and was mostly unnecessary, and I'm not just saying that because it made me and the people I was watching the episode with feel slightly uncomfortable.Overall I felt that this was a very good second episode for Season 7 as it provided many elements missing from the premiere. By the looks of it, its only going to get colder and more intense from here on, so stay tuned folks. My actual rating: 9.6/10"
477," Not Game of Thrones!
",6,False,"Game of thrones has become too popular both among viewers around the world and critics because of its complexity, smart dealing with details and unbelievable sanity in story line which is a rare thing in any program that includes fantasy. Even the twists which were often against the audience's wish were completely acceptable and challenging. those specifications, no doubt, mainly came from the George R R martin's strong work at ""A song of Ice and Fire"" novels. After the show surpassed the books, we have been expecting less quality but this level of downgrade is too much. Although, there are still some good acts and plots remained in the show including the north part with Jon and Sir Davos, the rest is ruined. The dialogues are too lame,drama is poorly developing and characters show no surprise or creativity as we used too see them before. Development is important, fore example maybe if we could see what has happen to Melisandre after Jon banished her from the north, her words with Dany would be more pleasant. Euron Greyjoy is not just a poor character with almost zero development. The most disappointment thing about him is that he is a sign and also a result of unfamiliar story telling where there isn't a strong writing to back the story. Cersei is too repetitive and predictable. Dany and Tyrion have been trapped in a terrifying fusion of two main characters and are fading since season 6. Also, after consuming all the books' material, we haven't seen proper replacement for diminishing of strong characters. It looks like reducing the number of episodes from 10 to 7 has nothing too do with improvement of the quality and is all about the lack of materials, simply they don't know how to make the rest. I believe lack of material and development has brought the show to the place where This episode, just like the previous one, did not belonged to Game of Thrones we knew!"
478," Sacrificing logic and good storytelling to further the narrative
",3,False,"For the most part I have really enjoyed the writing for Game of Thrones but my god was it horrible this episode. Specifically in regards to Cersei and the writers' desire to make her appear more formidable. First, the scene with Randyll Tarly was stupid. It implies that Jaime and Cersei eventually convince Randyll to betray their allegiance the House Tyrell. Randyll Tarly appears to be very old fashioned and someone who takes his oath to House Tyrell rather seriously which makes absolutely no sense that he would betray House Tyrell. But what makes it beyond ridiculous is he is choosing to side with the person who killed Mace, Loras and Margaery Tyrell. I find it particularly infuriating that there seems to be no mention or ramifications with Cersei blowing up the Sept Of Baelor and murdering everyone inside. I mean surely the death of the High Sparrow and Margaery Tyrell who were very popular amongst the commoners would raise some tension? Surely murdering the lord and heirs to Highgarden would at the very least cause anger amongst those loyal to House Tyrell? Apparently not. Instead joining them is what the writers would have you believe is the right thing to do. Also the Euron Greyjoy scenes which whilst entertaining, were downright illogical and made no sense. Firstly, am I honestly expected to believe that half of the Greyjoy army is capable of defeating the other half of the Greyjoy army AND House Martell? I mean House Martell is one of the great houses and the only house that were able to withstand the dragons of the Targaryen Conquest. They alone should have easily been able to dispatch Euron Greyjoy's army. But apparently, them AND the other half of the Greyjoy army couldn't defeat Euron Greyjoy. Oh and also, apparently Euron Greyjoy's inferior and probably very hastily made ships have ... STEALTH MODE. Where they are able to move at a slow pace but still be able to sneak up on other ships whilst trying to manoeuvre as a fleet. Visually, this episode was great which we have come to expect. It had the shock value. But also the sexy times which I was actually surprised that they handled so well. However, judging from the first two episodes, the writers have completely disregarded having a good narrative in favour of epic sequences. I'm not sure whether the writers don't understand that what they are writing doesn't make sense or they expect the audience to be stupid and only want to see what Game Of Thrones has become so well known for - violence and sex. However, seeing this episode has made me want to skip the next few episodes and wait till I start seeing the white walker invasion."
479," Sea battle at night
",7,False,"I like « Games of Thrones », it is fantasy world series that does keep errors to a strict minimum. But the last scene of season 7 episode 2 is ridiculous! A sea battle at night in the middle age period or before? Or even a battle at night? How does one recognize a friend from a foe? Not only that but how do you find the enemy fleet at night, there are no electric lights to guide your fleet, at night fleet tend to navigate in a loose order to try to not board friendly ships. More so a fleet does have some lookouts to prevent this type of encounter with land and other non-friendly ships or boats. Here in this episode no lookouts, everyone is asleep in the fleet?! Sail ships have sails like you can see in the episode, go to any sea and you shall see that they can be seen from far away even if there is only one boat and sail, so this surprise sea battle in the middle of the night, No, it is ridiculous, stupid an error from the writers! Sorry for them but a big mistake there."
480," Another solid episode!
",10,True,Don't let the bad reviews fool you. 95% of those are coming from salty book purists or fanboys of other shows that are crying because their favorite show will never even come close to the very scale and magnitude of Game of Thrones. The episode was great from start to finish. People complaining about wooden dialogue are again just the salty book purists who have a stick so far up their a** that it literally comes out of their mouth when they talk. These first two episodes have had amazing build up and I cannot wait to see what comes next.
481," Season continues to deliver spectacularly
",8,True,"First off, I cannot emphasize just how exemplary the editing and the music can be. This episode was thrilling, hilarious and heartbreaking simultaneously. A couple of unexpected reunions occur and they are almost tear-inducing. The cast persist on delivering wonderful performances and this episode also seems to be setting the stage for the remainder of the season; all hell is going to break loose very soon. Season 7 thus far seems to be off to a much better start than the previous season and it will hopefully be just as epic to witness. This series never fails to impress in every way and entertain in a visceral and masterful way throughout, and this episode is no exception."
482," ""Here's my status update""
",6,False,"This episode was basically every character delivering their status update. A lot of exposition provided by contrived, cringy, uninspired, badly written dialogue and close-ups of cued facial expressions (Littlefinger I'm looking at you as you recycle your standard ""smirking at Sansa as she's discontent with Jon Snow's status update"" look). I felt like I was watching Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the clones. As early as the 20 minute mark I was starting to look at the clock to see if this episode was about to be over because it felt like it had dragged on forever and I just wanted it to be over.There were some nice scenes involving Samwell Tarly.The big finale of the episode was Theon and Yara Greyjoy getting their asses, and their fleet, wiped by their uncle, which could've been an intense scene if it weren't for the fact that the show has done such a p1ss poor job at establishing Euron Greyjoy as the powerful villain he now apparently is. Seriously, is this the guy the show-runners intend to follow in the footsteps of Joffrey and Ramsay?This was easily the least good episode of GoT, so far."
483," Why are you heading this direction GOT?
",3,False,"I love Game of Thrones. I love it because of the immersion, the feeling I am experiencing this conflict with my very own eyes but they're losing it. They're losing the tension in every scene because they're completely fighting the unpredictable world of Game of Thrones and it's become boring.I don't know who this director is or why he's directing the show but he's directed my least favourite GOT episodes. He thinks tension comes from making main characters superheroes. Please, for the love of God, we're not 12 year olds watching superhero movies. We can think logically, and what you've made is far from it. We don't want to see stupid predictable fight scenes which favour main characters. Before this person directed Aya getting stabbed lethally and being completely fine in the next day, jumping off buildings, killing a superior assassin who slowly chased he,r like the overused cliché and then for plot convenience only, Jaq'uen now regarded her as one of their own. That's not a story. That's ridiculous. SPOILERS Then you have the last scene in this episode. Honestly I liked the rest of this episode. And then, oh boy. There was no doubting Euron was going to win that battle, I'm surprised he did with this director on board. What I thought would be more likely is that he'd rather make Yara momentarily turn into a dragon to fend off Euron's fleet and then everyone returns safely because from my experience, he's that type of director, but he came close. You have none of the crew members noticing the incoming fleet. However I'll let that go since Euron is exceptional on the sea, even if that means something. Then Euron fills the role of a mortal kombat character. Performing fatalities on the sand snakes. Is this entertaining? I know he's supposed to be a crazy character but this is stupid. I also didn't know he was invincible. Sand Snakes, famous for their poisons have no effect on him, they also all become exceptionally s*** fighters for plot conveniences. The same women that fought and matched Jaime and his bodyguard now cannot 2v1 Euron. And I don't see why he killed the two sands in such stupid manner in the first place while showing mercy to the other 2 and then Yara. I'm sorry, I'm not watching Game of Thrones anymore. I'm watching mainstream TV shows and movies where they'll go to great lengths to save characters for plot convenience and keep incrimemting the difficulty to unreasonable levels. It's predictable. The reason I hate all other TV shows. No tension is created in the scenes. And it becomes repetitive and boring. Something this director is going to great lengths to try and achieve. For God's sake. If main characters are crucial to the plot, don't put them in impossible situations, and then unrealistically save them in the last second by a mysterious stranger , or turn them into superheroes. It's not interesting, you're not creative for doing this, you're not making the scene better, I'm not hooked to the screen after seeing it for the umpteenth time. This show is now overrated, it's as highly rated as the first 3 seasons but comes nowhere close in quality. I don't understand what show these other people are watching because what I'm watching now is not GoT, it's a circus act. This makes me extremely sad because season 6 was horrendous, mostly because of the episode 'No one' but I decided to give it another shot this season and it was going fine until this last scene. This is the type of show you want it to be now? I really just hope the show changes course, and I blame this director who is incompetent and brain dead and gets picked up straight from main stream Hollywood films and makes my favourite show bad. And I don't see them changing anytime soon. RIP to another good TV show ruined by repetitive predictability. There is no excuse for this, not episode constraints because a kid could have directed a better scene than this pompous director. Any true GoT fans who is fascinate by the lore, theories, predictions, characters, history, could direct this better. This is embarrassing to watch now.For the casual viewer, some scenes are quite surprising, like Jon being a Targaryen. They probably don't even understand the significance of that, or how it happened. They'll probably be shocked when Jaime kills Cersei, along with this director who'll completely misrepresent the characters and their intentions. However for the GoT nerds like me, who have multiple theories, no suspense is created at all. They seem to pick the most popular and easy and obvious theories or plot, and just roll it out. And I fully expect the rest of the show to carry on like this. Basically meaning that the show is obvious, something GoT never should've been and is an embarrassment to George RR Martin.I no longer am immersed by GoT. The show was very special to me because of the alternate world it posed for me and the alternate universe I was perceiving but now it's just like all other TV shows. I hate reading, like extremely, and with the high quality of GoT, I never read the books but seeing what this show has become, I'll gladly read the books."
484," You haters still doubt that GAME OF THRONES isn't the best TV show ever was or ever will be?
",10,True,"Well, what can i say .. The episode was just pure gold, from the very start until the end. From the writing, directing, music , everything was on point, the opening scene gave the perfect meaning to the episode's title and they gave us too much for one episode. So let's talk first about Nymeria, SHE'S BACK LADIES AND GENTELMEN, but sadly she left again and i believe we're going to see her again, that's the point of her appearance after all, she's all grown up, she has a pack so it's confirmed that Nymeria and her pack will have a role to play in the future otherwise they won't bring her back at the first place, it wasn't for nothing. The rest of the episode now, WOW, just WOW .. everything was set up perfectly, Dany is making some decisions, Tyrion plans the conquest and everything is going well, or at least that's what we thought . Cersei is making new alliances, and they gave us a hint about how they will fight the dragons back. Jon left Winterfell with Davos leaving Sansa as a ruler, he's heading to Dragonstone to meet Dany so he can convince her to join him in the war to come. And Sam, OH MY, what a brave decision, his story-line is starting to get better, it appears that dragons glass has something to do with the Grey scale, that's why Shireen was cured when she went to dragonstone, dragon glass is the cure, it made sense after all, i assume that Jorah is safe for now. Arya is finally heading north after she found out that Jon and Sansa has taken their home back. And finally, the ending, after such a long wait, we had some pretty good actions scenes, an amazing sea battle, and let's not talk about Euron, just OMFG, this is the Euron Greyjoy we need, he's turning out to be one hell of a villain , Dany's choice cost her a huge loss, she lost two of her strongest allies and she lost her first battle. Yara, Ellaria, Tyenne are held captivities by our beloved Euron, and i assume they are his priceless gift for Cersei. Anyway, the episode was perfect, we had everything in it, action, romance, drama, blood, turn of events, SATISFYING deaths, revelations, that's a promising episode for what's coming next, now, next episode please!9,5/10"
485," The last minutes ruined the episode
",3,False,"Brilliant episode until the last minutes.Spoiler starts here: Are you people for real? A few ships filled with Ironborn couldn't see ""the greatest armada this world has ever seen"" coming their way?Why, because it was at night and the ships are black? And the lookout didn't know how to read the water? Or listen to the wind?Lazy writing ruined the strategy, the episode and most probably the whole season because of that.Absolutely bloody awful."
486," Very entertaining, even if it's no longer as intelligent without the books
",9,True,"As much as I'd like to talk about specifics, I don't want to risk spoilers so I'll just talk about pros and cons in a handy list however I'll drop one little spoiler later on so watch out. Pros: +Great direction and cinematography as always +Great production design as always+Great acting from the whole cast, mainly Maisie who is getting much more human moments rather than the robotic role she had in seasons 5 & 6 +Great moments in both dialogue (doesn't mean the writing is good quality, just entertaining) and action, specifically the end which was incredibly entertaining (even if it was a tad bit too unrealistic)Cons: -Without the books, the dialogue will always suffer but it is better than usual and definitely better than the average show today-Too fast paced for me personally. I like the characters and plot lines converging but I want a but more time to process things. For example, Melisandre is in and out in like 1 minute and forgot about her existence by the end of the episode. -Ill admit, it was the trailers and a couple of set leaks that ruined the show for me but it's still a bit too predictable. I don't think shock value makes the show any better like some people but it's still not good to make things very predictable because it just feels convenient for the viewer which ruins the emotion (For example, SPOILER WARNING SPOILERS!!! when Euron kills Obara and Nymeria, it's obvious they are keeping the least annoying Sand Snake alive who showed her ""assets"" to the audience as they are cutting down on hated characters. If they were going to kill the Sand Snakes, they should have just killed them all, I doubt Tyene would just give up like she does in the episode. -I love the books a lot but I don't care about accuracy in adaptations. However, some people do. Let's just say it's gotten worse. The books have been 100% abandoned at this point. Just a warning to religious book fans who hate the divergence in the showOverall, a solid 8.5/10. Classic GoT episodes from the season 4 days would be a perfect 10 for me so 8.5 is a decent score for the start of this season considering they no longer have the books to follow. I respect that they are trying and it's still very entertaining television even if it isn't as amazing as it was a couple of years ago. For me, seasons 5-7 is like The Hobbit Trilogy. Just because the Lord of the Rings are perfect films that no one has ever matched up to, it doesn't make the Hobbit bad, it's just not as good. Still entertaining just like these past 3 seasons even if they can't surpass the already perfect seasons which were 1-4"
487," Playing Follow up!
",5,False,"Somehow the show writers got the gist of the ending from GRRM, it lacks drama, substance and moreover it is not how Game of thrones used to be. Yes, we all loved(hated) GoT for its unexpected twists, but from the last season the show runs on familiar grounds giving no room for twists or drama.I specifically emphasize on drama part because nobody talks in GoT from season 6, they are just filling up the silence with few sentences, it clearly shows when the wittiest character of the show who has been known for several epic speeches speaks hardly five lines in two episodes. They are clearly rushing to the end, tying up the knots. If they don't have enough material, they should have waited. I think they are ruining what Game of Thrones accomplished in first five seasons."
488," The episode was awesome
",10,True,Really this show surprises me every time more i am a long fan of the series and this episode was so great... when jon thretened LF gave me chills really it was one of my favorite scenes and it was long awaited thank you HBO.i think its far more better now that jon is king in the north.
489," How to be a dragon
",9,True,"In Essos Daenerys has largely been running her own show. In Westeros she need allies, and an interesting power struggle is now breaking out around her. How should she go about conquering Westeros? ""Be a dragon"", Lady Oleanna advices. But can you actually be a benevolent dragon?"
490," Now the Seventh Season Has Begun
",9,True,"At Dragonstone, Daenerys, Tyrion and Varys discuss a strategy to take Westeros without burning the Seven Kingoms to ashes with their allied Melisandre, Yara Greyjoy, Eliaria and Lady Olenna Tyrell. Tyrion proposes an alliance with Jon Snow to Daenerys and she sends an invitation to him to visit her. In Kings Landing, Cersei tries to gather allied to fight Daenerys and Qyburn shows a powerful weapon to kill dragons he has developed. Meanwhile Jon Snow decides to accept the invitation of Daenerys expecting to convince her to use her dragons and the dragon glass in her land to destroy the White Walkers. Arya learns that Jon Snow is the King of the North and decides to return to Winterfells and has an unexpected encounter. Samwell tries to secretly heal Jorah from the greyscale risking his career. Yara Greyjoy and Eliaria are navigating the Narrow Sea when they are surprisingly attacked by Euron and his fleet. ""Stormborn"" is a great episode of ""Game of Thrones"" with good segments and surprising conclusion. Now the strategies are discussed by the opponents with their allied and the war is close. Most of the characters have great participation and the viewers will certainly anxiously looking forward to see the sequel. My vote is nine.Title (Brail): ""Stormborn"""
491," A brilliant Game of Thrones looks to the past to strategise its future
",8,True,"The episode kicks off with Daenerys, so we will too. Finally allowed to speak more than three words, her first real conversation comes in the form of an interrogation of Varys, bringing to light a part of the show's history perhaps we'd all forgotten. Varys is almost renowned for abandoning his leaders when he stops agreeing with them, double crossing them and venturing to the other side of the battle. What's to say he won't just do the same whenever Dany doesn't see eye to eye with him? It's a riveting scene - even more so for the way Dany shuts Tyrion out when he tries to diffuse the tension, this isn't his moment - and Emilia Clarke and Conleth Hill act the hell out of it. I'd comfortably label it the pair's strongest dialogue led scene in a very long time, the kind of focused, verbal sparring match Game of Thrones used to excel at but now rarely indulges in. It was great to have that back again.There's also the undeniable thrill of seeing so many characters in the same scene. Check out the occupants of Dragonstone's war room: Dany, Tyrion, Varys, Grey Worm, Missandei, Olenna, Theon, Yara and Ellaria. Even just seeing them together feels like momentum, so to have them strategising over their plans to invade King's Landing is exciting in all the ways last week's premiere wasn't. Characters are plotting their course, they're talking about what they're going to and, in a rare success for Game of Thrones, it feels legitimately thrilling. There's a certain flair to Mark Mylod's direction in the Dragonstone war room, the way the camera cuts to so many faces, picking up so many reactions. It would've been very easy for an episode like this to slip back into mundanity and feel like more place holding, but instead it feels momentous.While Dany looks into the past to question Varys, Cersei thinks back to the previous Targaryen ruling of King's Landing to help her prepare for the upcoming war. After a mixed bag of an attempt to rally supporting houses to her side, she retreats to a dungeon under the city with Qyburn to discover his latest, dragon-killing weapon. Again, Mylod's direction here is stunning. Cersei stands next to the skeletal remains of the Mad King's biggest dragon, her whole body not even reaching the height of its skull. As well as giving Cersei and the Lannisters a kind of back up defence and helping to even the playing field, it works as foreshadowing - is this the size Drogon will be by the time Dany attacks? Will we get a similar shot of Cersei standing by his freshly killed head? There's something about this sequence that oozes suggestion and warning, a very one-sided war is starting to look more balanced.This idea of reflecting on the past to assist the future crops up elsewhere, too. Sam helps to treat Jorah's greyscale out of respect for his father, who he served during his tenure at the Night's Watch. The scene is annoyingly played for humour again - Sam is more than comic relief, guys - but it connects with the rest of the episode far better than his time last week did. When Jon receives a raven from Tyrion inviting him to Dragonstone, it's his fond memory of Tyrion that helps him overlook the idea that it could be a trap. We know that it isn't, of course, but it's nice to see characters in Game of Thrones take precautions again. This is a war, after all, Sansa is right to be cautious. Jon leaves anyway, sided with Davos, and makes his way for Dragonstone in what could lead to the most exciting character meet the show has offered yet.Perhaps the episode's biggest surprise comes in the form of Arya Stark, though. A character I had already written off as lost after last week's dire attempts at moving her forward, Arya undergoes a serious course correction here. Her first scene with Hot Pie is jarring in that, yet again, she feels like an entirely different character - something the show could be exploring cleverly, yet isn't - but it's saved by its ending with Arya learning that her brother has reclaimed the North. She decides to go there instead, temporarily (I think?) abandoning her plan of killing Cersei, but soon runs into Nymeria, her old Direwolf whom she forced to flee back in season one. As Arya stares into her eyes, the wolf eventually leaves again, but this has left Arya with a sense of optimism - the moment she learns she has family remaining, her previous companion returns to her side, even if only for a moment. I stand corrected, there's hope for the youngest Stark girl yet.""Stormborn"" eventually concludes with the Greyjoy fleet coming under attack by Euron, and it doesn't quite stick the landing. The battle is too sudden, not pulling off the same shock effect as the sensational ""Hardhome"" did back in season five. The action is supposed to come across as frantic and unorganised, and this is reflected in the editing and direction, but it doesn't make for a particularly thrilling sequence. There's too much going on over too small an environment, leading to a mess of small moments that fail to coalesce into one larger whole. Still, what the battle represents for the show's future is enticing enough for the sloppy execution to be forgiven. Dany had her plan set out, and she won over her council. Now, she's lost her biggest fleet and can't connect with one of her most useful armies. Remember I said this one-sided battle was starting to even out? Game of Thrones seemed to be falling into a predictable route to its endgame, but ""Stormborn"" lands as a jolt to the system, both acknowledging the past and shaking up the future. More like this, please."
492," Unreal
",3,False,"It is not about how Euron knew the plan of Tyrion. It is about why he took so many hits all over his body (including his private parts) and he didn't die (felt like nothing for him). I know, he's a major character now and he's of great use, but it just doesn't make any sense."
493," Putting Dorne out of its misery
",6,False,"When I learned the title of the episode I braced myself for impact, expecting to be writing a review raving about Hitlaerys Sturmborn and how much I despise her, but I was wrong. Because fortunately, there was not so much Daenerys in the episode and it was in fact quite enjoyable, for the much lowered standards of the series post late-fifth season. The lowered standards will hopefully become evident as we delve deeper into this, I repeat, rather good episode (more a 7 than a 6 but I will not indulge).Now, we know that Daenerys is D&D's favourite, to the point of endless streams of vomit. They've taken a character who is well meaning, but behaves like (and, in fact, is) a stubborn child who doesn't listen to anyone and turned her into a (supposedly) wise ruler who heeds all the different counsel by her advisers before contemplating a decision. However, in this case, this didn't bother me - even if I don't see how Daenerys suddenly remembered to be suspicious of Varys, or appreciate how Melissandre is reduced to some kind of plot device, I was, after a long time, not annoyed by the Daenerys scenes. Buuuuut. Here's the thing. You have to see how there is zero surprise in the plot. Even when it's not full of holes, it's just obvious and fan-pampering. An alliance is proposed between Daenerys and Jon Snow! Really? I am not sure if Jon will actually go himself (I suspect he may end up sending Davos because he has to do something), but an auto-pilot script is not what this show became known for. And you know what, I do not expect you to be as good at it as GRRM, but since you are nowhere near the actual plot by now, can't you at least try to be unpredictable?The same goes for Sam - I really liked the Oldtown scenes, but the whole thing was Lessons in Cliché 1.01. Senior wise man says there is no cure. Novice claims there is one, but senior dismisses it as ""too dangerous"". Novice tries it anyway, successfully (OK, not certain yet, let's say ""with at least temporary success""). Of course, no sign of ""danger"" actually appears, and if a guy who's just enrolled can do it, it becomes all the sillier.Then you have King's Landing: Cersei keeps searching for allies and Jaime convinces Lord Tarly to help them - and OK, his argument against maintaining allegiance to house Tyrell is half-convincing, but you know, she just murdered Lord Tyrell, the Queen, the head of the church, and a bunch of other nobles, and Jaime is like ""you should totally trust us, not the other guys"". There is zero reason for any noble family to support Cersei. Hell, there is zero reason why Jaime hasn't already abandoned her. Oh, and by the way, Cersei's wizard-necromancer is working on a solution how to kill dragons. It's a ballista. At first I thought, ""yep, undead bone-dragon, that's a bit outrageous but cool"", but no, it was a big crossbow.In the North, I'll ignore the Daenerys summons discussion, and focus on how terribly ungrateful everyone is to Lord Baelish. Seriously, dudes. You are all horrible human beings for no reason at all - oh wait, not for no reason, it is so Petyr will eventually turn against them, right? Yeah, very subtle. Of course, someone is already saying ""but he gave Sansa to Ramsay!"", and yes, sure, but 1. Sansa also thought 'yeah, I'm not certain, but it doesn't sound like the worst idea ever' 2. this idea actually was the worst ever, and the stupidest plot of the entire show, so I would expect them to try and make the audience forget about it.......much like they did with Dorne. The show, having butchered the Dorne story-line beyond recognition, having reduced Doran Martell and Aryo Hotah to a couple of background extras who get murdered having taken no part in the story, having turned the Sandsnakes into a joke about ""worst dialogues in the history of television"", decides to put this poor abomination out of its misery. Well, Ellaria and one of her daughters may have survived to one day remind us of the Dornish trainwreck (gift to Cersei I guess), but the rest of them are dispensed with quickly, after sharing one last really cringe-worthy exchange, discussing how many Lannisters each one will kill in King's Landing...the battle that leads to this purge is cool enough, I liked Theon's reversal back to Reek, but, yet again, it's not all too surprising is it? Daenerys has been given everything by the show. The Lannisters have next to nothing, so Euron has to be elevated to super-villain status to provide some semblance of suspense. So who of the Daenerys allies will they get rid of? The ones they have mutilated the most (the Martells), and the Greyjoys, who are not too well- loved.So all in all, a good episode, which serves to remind us the woes of lacking your source of inspiration."
494," Doesn't quite send up a storm
",7,False,"Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.Up to this very early point of 'Game of Thrones' penultimate season, my initial impression of Season 7 has been decent and promising but not completely satisfying. It is the season that settled the least quickly in my mind and it is not hard to see some of the disappointment with fans. The season opener ""Dragonstone"" epitomised the above, while ""Stormborn"" makes improvements but there are signs of the promising but not entirely satisfying feel of the start of Season 7. Can see the high critical praise, but am somewhere in the high middle of the very divisive fan reaction.""Stormborn"", while not quite sending up a storm as much as ought, does improve upon ""Dragonstone"". Things continue to be introduced, set up and put into place while there is enough intrigue to the existing characters and stories. Compared to ""Dragonstone"", ""Stormborn"" is far more eventful, has more tension in the character relationships, progresses characters (especially Arya) and storylines better, most scenes here serve far more of a point and don't feel like overlong padding and there are no misplaced or jarring cameos. At the same time, ""Stormborn"" did feel on the rushed side. If the pace had slowed down, character motivations would have been clearer and the character writing much more consistent. Euron, who continues to be written poorly, especially is inconsistent and doesn't make sense, and Yara and Ellania fare little better. The intimate scene between Grey Worm and Missandrei was drawn out and unnecessary, the only scene that felt like filler, and some of the writing doesn't flow very naturally and is uncharacteristically corny. Luckily, there are some great scenes, conflicts and characterisation to balance out what didn't work. The Arya, Daenerys and Dragonstone scenes are beautifully done, as are the chemistry between Daenerys and Jon and Tyrion and Littlefinger being as ever awesome. Another highlight is the exciting, affecting and gorgeously filmed climactic action sequence.In terms of acting, ""Stormborn"" is solid. There aren't any tour-De-force performances or especially outstanding ones, but nobody is terrible either. Maisie Williams, Emilia Clarke, Aidan Gillen, Kit Harrington and Peter Dinklage come off strongest. That for Euron is the weak link, but much of it is down to how Euron is written which would be beneath any actor.Visually, it looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot not mention the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.Enough layers, passion and sensitivity in the writing, even if they don't come consistently.Summing up, decent episode but as 'Game of Thrones' has done so many masterpiece part of me couldn't help feeling disappointed. 7/10 Bethany Cox"
495," Boring...
",3,False,"Again, this has not improved. Boring, slow and without emotion and not surprising at all.The first episode I did not like, but this one has been worse than the previous one.Maybe my expectations are higher than the reality, but for me it's a shame that a good television program is getting worse at times.I hope that in the ones that are still to be broadcast they will introduce more emotion, surprises and intrigue, with something more vitality in the characters, as it happened in seasons 1, 2, 3 and 4."
496," Stormborn is a storm
",8,True,"To be fair, this was a great improvement from the previous episode. This episode literally featured no filler scene. What seemed like a filler/buildup was nothing but a callback sequence and was entertaining all the same. Like we did for the last episode, lets run down from the best to the worst.1. Arya-Nymeria. Arya, to me, is a clear winner again. In fact this episode proves that one doesn't need shocking murders to steal the spotlight. Arya-Nymeria is the second reunion this season (after Arya-Hot Pie, which took place in the same episode) and it has been one of the longest awaited ones. The direwolf mirrors Arya's character. Arya was never meant to marry a high lord and spawn a lot of children. She is a fighter. An assassin, who has killed the human inside and seeks only revenge for all that her family has gone through. All we had gained in the last season was that Arya is dead inside but she proved it wrong when she chose to head home instead of going to King's Landing. She showed she still has the basic human emotions. But here is why Nymeria sequence, though heartbreaking, is very crucial. It reminds Arya that she is not the little girl who wanted to head home. It reminds Arya that she currently has a To-Kill List and there is a name that sits right at the top of it, powerful and in all glory. She might head South again after all. Let's see.2. Samwell-Jorah. I find this to be the most underrated sequence of the episode. We don't take much back from this sequence in terms of content but in terms of psychological interpretations, it hits a home run. We learn more about Sam's benevolent nature here. The direction (probably in only this scene in the whole episode) is marvelous and Jorah's acting is beyond words.3. Daenerys. I was disappointed by the last episode because it featured three words from Dany despite the episode being called Dragonstone. Here, of course, Dany plays the most important role. There is a certain thing about Dany's tone that is bothering. Even though we know what she is saying is reasonable and probably right, the rudeness and arrogance takes away the validity from it. It looks like, even though she is gentle and caring deep down, she is trying very hard to exercise power. Not in a Joffrey kind of way. No, she is not a freak. But in a forced Mad King sort of way. Her sequence with Varys was interesting. I know she may receive a lot of flack for that, but then so should Jon for being rude to his 'saviour' Baelish. What is wrong with Dany is that she is surrounded by fools whose main motive is revenge, not justice. They don't care about how many people die for the purpose of their mindless revenge. But I believe as long as Tyrion is by her side, she will remain sane because she really does listen to him. 4. The siege. The battle, though mildly surprising, could have been better directed. The camera movements were way too sharp and quick and not at all smooth, possibly because of usage of body doubles, which made it look more disturbing than exciting. Yet it was a good turn of events and leaves us hanging to wonder how Tyrion and Dany are going to deal with this sudden turn of events. Finally, after two blatantly predictable seasons, the old Game of Thrones-level complication might have returned. It also showcased how Tyrion, who had been rather flawless in the Blackwater battle's scheming, has been outwitted by Euron.5. Jon-Sansa. To be fair, this scene showed another development and we're finally headed towards the much sought after Jon-Dany meet. People have been waiting for 7 years for this to happen. Watching Jon fight for it, though for entirely different reason, was definitely a treat. Dany's ""He sounds like quite a man"" was also quite entertaining. Baelish seems to have lost his grasp. We will discover the truth of it in the next episode. Jon-Sansa tension seems to fading out already. 6. The scissors. Missandei-Greyworm sequence, though placed for the 'necessary' nudity, also plays a crucial role in human-ization of the mechanical Unsullied.7. Cersei. *sigh* As she had become in season 6, up until the finale, Cersei has become a dull-dud, mere-words woman. Her scenes have become blatantly boring and it seems like the writers and director(s) are at a lack of imagination on how to make the viewers stay hooked to what she is saying. Even though Lena is still doing a good job, the character has lost its evilness that made us hate her, yet want to watch her. This sequence is one of the major disappointments of an otherwise brilliant episode.Overall, a good, engaging episode with a lot going on. Keep more of this coming D&D. I'm going with an 8/10."
497," Storytelling At Its Finest
",10,True,"Season 7 of Game of Thrones has consistently improved in quality with every episode. Episode 3 ""The Queen's Justice"" was an epic hour of television, to say the least.Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen's first meeting was everything that I expected it to be. Through firsthand witnessing the dichotomy between the two, ice and fire, we realize that they are more similar than we ever thought. Both outliers of their respective societies who rose to the height of the hierarchy. During their second scene together they seem to find some common ground, and Daenerys is willing to set aside her pride in an investment of sorts, hoping that Jon will bend the knee and compensate for her lost allies. Despite a rough clash between them initially, it appears as if they will eventually compromise to defeat each other's enemies. Either that, or the realm will suffer.Cersei's punishment of the Sand Snakes was a poetic end to their reign over Dorne. For the first time in a while, we are able to obtain a glimpse into Cersei's more human side, the sympathetic aspects of her personality and past which once made us feel so ambiguous about her. The acting from the Sand Snakes was surprisingly good, yet the real star of this scene was Lena Headey. Also, for the second episode in a row, Euron Greyjoy delivers spectacularly and receives further characterization.Meanwhile, in Winterfell, Sansa is demonstrating that she could potentially develop into a fine ruler over the North in Jon's absence due to the venture to Dragonstone. The reunion between her and Bran is the highlight of this storyline, and the reveal that he was completely aware of what transpired during her wedding was heartbreaking. Bran also seems disorientated this season, as if the pressure of taking on the responsibilities of the Three-Eyed Raven is impacting him mentally. Only time will tell if he finally receives some development after six seasons of being the least- developed main character.Once again, the highlight of this episode is a battle. Yet instead of demonstrating visual prowess via special effects and outlandish stunts, the battle for Casterly Rock and the Siege of Highgarden are told as if they are part of a larger story. Tyrion's narrative over these conflicts are potentially the best dialogue he has had since the finale of Season 4. The storytelling was perfect and once again, this season emulates various aspects from the first four installments. Some may say that this was a cop-out, but I believe the sequence was conveyed subtly but masterfully. The scene between Olenna Tyrell and Jaime Lannister at the episode's end was especially great. She has Jaime completely dissected and vocalizes the inner conflict that he has been engaged in from the very beginning of Cersei's descent into madness. He is so profoundly devoted to her that he is willfully blind to her cruelty. Olenna confesses to murdering Joffrey, and Jaime displays some doubt pertaining to his unquestioned loyalty to his sister. It has been a while, but we are finally seeing some more character development for Jaime.A fantastic episode, proving that Season 7 possesses a degree of consistency regarding the quality of consecutive episodes, which has been absent recently."
498," Fire Meets Ice
",10,True,"This episode proved to be exactly what I had hoped to get out of an episode that saw Jon Snow and Daenerys meet for the first time. And although that meeting was the core of the episode, it was far from the only important thing that happened tonight. Every scene was beautifully constructed and garnered importance for the long-run. So much so that I know there will be a great deal of scenes I forget to mention in this review. But everyone played their part, and played it well.Beginning in Dragonstone (where we had around 20 minutes of incredible interplay!), Jon & Daenerys didn't get off to the greatest of starts. Even before that, I should mention just how cool it was to see Jon witness 3 dragons fly over his head. 7 seasons guys, and Jon has finally seen a dragon. That and his quippy scenes with Tyrion were a good appetizer to what was to come in Dragonstone. Speaking of Tyrion, I figured he would be the key to this alliance, and his presence was nothing short of vital. Just watching Peter Dinklage listen to the back and forth to Jon & Dany was scene blocking at its best. The blocking in particular between Jon & Dany was impressive as well. It certainly echoes their ancestor's history, as did all of their well-strung dialogue. I honestly couldn't have imagined a better written scene. I understand both sides for sure. Dany has spent the entire length of the show trying to make her way to the iron throne and Jon has spent the better half of the last few seasons battling the dead, there isn't a lot of wiggle room for either side. Which is why I'm glad that the meeting ended up being ambiguous and left open for next week. The aftermath of last week's Greyjoy destruction was certainly felt as Euron walked Ellaria and Yara through the streets of King's Landing like they were his pets. Not sure how Yara's capture will be handled, but it was hard not to see how the Sand family situation was going to go down. Even so, it was devastatingly brutal to watch a mother and daughter not be able to console each other. I've never felt any sort of sympathy towards the Sand's, but Indira Varma's performance was remarkable enough to make me feel something for her.Albeit brief, the time spent in Winterfell was nothing short of awesome. I came around on Sansa a while ago and I really enjoy seeing her in a position of power, especially when she's finally one-upping Littlefinger at his own game. That speech he gave her about ""Everyone is your enemy and everyone is your friend"" summed up his character in one sentence so well. And THEN, Bran showed up, giving us exactly what the episode called for, just a little bit more emotion. I'm not ashamed to say that once again this season got me all teary eyed. These Stark reunions continue to be filled with so much earned emotion, and it looks like we may get another one next week.A few other tidbits (as per usual) that were noteworthy; the Jorah/Sam handshake was great, Melisandre and Varys scene was downright eerie and ominous, Cersei has never been more evil, Daenerys saying ""I'm the last Targaryen"" was pretty on the nose but still clever, Tyrion & Davos always know what to say, the Casterly Rock/Highgarden battle stuff was short but sweet, rest in peace Lady Olenna! We loved having you.+Writing+Legendary meeting+Heartwarming reunion+Major implications in every scene+The pace moves so fast this season10/10"
499," Even the word PERFECT can't describe how amazing and stunning this episode was !!
",10,True,"WOW !! This episode was cleverly done. It was by far the best episode of this season, i'm speechless ..The Queen's Justice has given us such a satisfying moments, it brought us forward in the story even faster than we thought possible., it was enjoyable, the storytelling is getting better than ever, beautifully written episode and thanks to D§D. And i'm sure the best is yet to come .."
500," Still brilliant, but writing is starting to get sloppy
",7,False,"I still love it, but I feel the producers have made a bit of a hash over much of this season. The plot and dialogue have lost much of their previous subtlety, edge and plausibility. It's like the odds were so overwhelmingly in favour of Daenerys at the start, they've had to carve out some contrived and tenuous plot line to make it more interesting. Almost half the Lannister army was wiped out by Robb and Stannis leaving, what, 25,000-30,000? Euron looked like he had about 40 men at his crowning, and the iron islands looked about as sparsely populated as the isle of man. This compared to Daenerys, who has 70,000+, 3 dragons and the support of basically everyone that isn't the Lannisters or Euron. Most of the other houses are said to be able to raise a comparable figure to the Lannisters alone, and they mainly despise Cercei.And now we are supposed to just accept that Euron and his gang have produced 1000 state of the art ships and reproduced sufficiently to man them in the time it took Yara to go to Mereen and back? That Daenerys would then send two of her key allies (Dorne and Yara) right past Kings Landing on ships (the only terrain where Cercei has the upper hand)? That Cercei has near perfect Intel and Daenerys, despite having Varys, seems to be acting blind? How can Euron can get back from the other side of the continent in that time, and arrive literally to the hour at the right moment, via a stop off in kings landing? That Daenerys can produce the inspiration to overcome the khals, win the unsullied, free herself from captivity etc. but yet no one in her 70,000 force seems to have mastered the basic war tactic of reconnaissance? And I get Tarly was a big part of the Tyrell army, but wtf was Olenna doing considering it was a time of war? Just don't let him freakin' leave. Why haven't you gathered the rest of your army? How were the Lannister force (think they said 12,000) able to take Highgarden, supposedly a massive fortress, in what looked like an afternoon? You could talk for yonks about Dorne as well, which they made a mess of generally. For one, were there no other lords or whatever loyal to Doran? He had like 10 guards when he got assassinated as well and they just watched. What are you there for if not to stop the king being murdered? And, given that, why would the capture of Ellaria and the snakes stop Dorne being an ally? Potentially that could be a worthwhile raven to send before you leave?Some of the dialogue has been good in places, but much of it seems implausible as well. In the past, Daenerys has – survived unscathed through a string of big fires, become the mother of dragons, experienced magic first hand on two separate occasions, seen one of her advisers succumb to greyscale and happily listens to prophecies by magical priestesses without a second thought and yet she doesn't entertain the idea of the white walkers? Why would there be a f*** off ancient massive ice wall in the north mate ?Condensing the last two seasons seems a really bad call now. They needlessly broke the pace of the show, and forced themselves into omitting some key plot development. Blackwater was built up to over the whole of season 2, and yet both Casterly rock and Highgarden were over with within 7 minutes of screen time. The whole thing just feels so rushed and sloppy - it's not like people are going to stop watching, nor is it financially in their interest as well."
501," Best one this season
",10,True,"Wow. What an episode. Living in Europe means I've got to stay up all night to watch these but it's worth it. After a slightly weaker 5th season, people thought Game of Thrones was going to lose it's momentum, but no. After a fantastic season six, HBO is bringing us a flawless seventh season. Everything is as good as it's ever been and this episode is no exception. First, the amazing feeling of Jon FINALLY meeting Daenerys, fire and ice coming together, with Tyrion (imo best character in anything ever) serving as the bridge between the two. I like how they resist the temptation to just have them like each other because ""they're both heroes of the story"" but instead handles they're interests in a smart and believable way. Then there's Jorah and Sam's part which in my opinion does seem a little rushed and too resolved for this show, but maybe they'll bring it back later. Then we have King's Landing, oh boy, with Euron being a complete bad ass that I both love and hate, a tragic end to the Martell family, and a great feeling of conflict in Jaime's story line. When it comes to Jaime, I thought he was definitely going to turn on Cercei, not necessarily kill her, but turn on her. But the great thing about this show is I don't know for sure anymore because he acts like a real human being who is madly in love and do anything for her. So will he turn on her or will his obsession for her be the end of him. Then what's happening in Winterfell; Sansa is such a bad ass now and is finally showing her true colours and what she's learned from Cercei, and when she greets Bran with a warm welcome she gets a rather cold ""Sup?"" back. They've all been through so much but I think Bran has changed the most, heck I would to if I became an all-seeing prophet. And then there's the ending, a great scene where the Unsullied storm the castle with Tyrion speaking over them. Only to find out that the Unsullied are now trapped in the castle they've just taken. Then the very end, where Jaime confronts Olenna and we see a bad ass end to The Queen of Thorns' story, and right after met with the credits.So holy s**t, what an episode! From the writing to the directing to the acting to the story to the production value, everything is as good as I expect from Game of Thrones. This really is the best show on television right now or maybe ever (but Breaking Bad is a pretty close second if so). Easily a 10/10 from me."
502," The perfect Game of Thrones episode
",10,True,"At first glimpse of the Queen's Justice title, I instantly thought that it was speaking of Dany, and by the end of this episode, I understood - Cersei will not be defeated that easily.This episode is the perfect Game of Thrones episode, mixing in politics, with schemes and ploys, and emotional scenes filled with breathtaking acting. Seeing Jon and Dany meet for the first time was as good as it could have been, you can see both their points. Dany wants to be a strong wise leader, and Jon wants to save his people from the oncoming threat. The dialogue between both characters was very well written, and felt like something George R. R Matrin had written himself.When Euron paraded the Sand Snakes through King's Landing, and presented them to Cersei, I couldn't help but feel happy for her, these people killed her daughter. This is what this show and episode does so well, we know Cersei is the bad guy, we know she's cruel and sadistic, but yet we also root for her. The Sand Snakes have never really been that important, so their demise is not really gut wrenching, but that scene between mother and daughter was really well done, and the acting from Indira Varma was flawless.We also get another reunion between two Starks. Seeing Bran arrive back at Winterfell was emotional, and seeing the look of Sansa's face was perfect. Sophie Turner has really upped her game this time around, and has been delivering some of her best ever acting. I also like that Sansa isn't being turned into another Cersei, she is actually appearing to be very good at ruling, thinking of her people before anything else, all the while listening to the scheming whispers of Littlefinger.The biggest part about this episode is its battle scenes. While unlike the previous battles we have seen, these ones feel poetic. And for the first time, Tyrion isn't the smartest guy in the room, he gets outplayed by Jamie, which is some very smart writing on the creators part. The siege of Casterly Rock was stunning, it was perfectly paced and served its purpose well. When we finally get a look at Highgarden, the absolutely stunning visuals in this scene has to be some of the best I've ever seen in TV. that glorious sunset that beamed across the arriving Lannister army was like something out of a painting.The final scene in this episode, played out brilliantly. With Lady Olenna Tyrell, despite her defeat, has managed to place one last wound in the Lannisters, by revealing that she in fact killed Joffery. This scene was so powerful and long coming, and the end of her character is something I am surely going to miss. The Queen's Justice is one of the best Game of Thrones episodes, because it not only felt like an episode from the earlier seasons, but blended in beautiful story telling with great visuals and powerful emotions.10/10"
503," Regal justice
",9,True,"Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.While mostly liking ""Dragonstone"" and ""Stormborn"", the previous episodes of Season 7, they were of the ""starting the season promisingly and decently but not entirely satisfyingly"" kind. ""The Queen's Justice"" is quite a big improvement, and definitely one of Season 7's better episodes as can be seen by it being one of the best-received episodes of the season. It may not be 'Game of Thrones' at its very best or quite prime 'Game of Thrones', but it very nearly is.""The Queen's Justice"" starts off a little too slowly perhaps and Euron is still not particularly well written. It is well worth the watch however for a lot of things. The Jon and Daenerys scenes have a lot of passion and intensity, there is a lot of tension and emotion and the climactic scenes are just riveting and sees a great character go out in style. In an episode that largely is a perfect mix of intricate character writing and interaction and pointed action.It follows on from the previous two episodes setting things and putting it all into place, and expands on them and even more. Things are more eventful than before, more intricate, have more tension in the character relationships, characters and storylines show better progression, there's very little if at all padding and nothing really jars. All the acting is on point, with Diana Rigg in particular giving the season's first proper tour-De-force performance.Visually, it looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot not mention the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.Layers, passion and sensitivity galore in the writing as well. The characters are very compellingly written and the interaction is handled intelligently. Most of the episode is very well paced and tight when it gets going. Overall, great. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
504," Two Queens and two styles of justice
",9,True,"SPOILER: Here we see Cersei and Daenerys handling power in very different ways.Cersei pursues vengeance, but sometimes against the wrong people. And is making promises she can't meet to the Iron Bank, and to Euron Greyjoy which she does not intend to keep.Is Euron Greyjoy really fooled? At the end, Olenna Tyrell lets Jamie know that Cersei was indeed wrong in blaming Tyrion for the death of Jofrey. A last act of malice, probably, since it will set him against Cersei. She caused much of the trouble including their father's death by her false accusation.Meantime Daenerys is losing because she tried to me merciful. And has sat in Dragonstone with her dragons, rather than going either to ferry the fleet from Dorn or help the Unsullied. Really no logic to it.On the positive side, she ends up being sensible about Jon Snow refusing to accept her as Queen of the North.We also get a repeat of the hint that the Red Priestesses know something Varys, who may have more secrets than he has revealed. One of them told him she knew what the demon said when he was a child. Now Melisandre tells him that both she and he are doomed to die in Westeros. And of course we don't know his story about his origins is true.She also speaks of the meeting of Jon and Daenerys as bringing ice and fire together. Has to mean something.Bran remains enigmatic, but presumably plans to tell Jon of his real parents. And does not trust Sansa with it. In fact he seems highly mistrustful of her."
505," The Phantom Menace
",4,False,"I have to say, the show fails at different aspects than the ones I fear ahead of watching it; for example, the Jon - Daenerys meeting is actually not cringe-worthy. In fact, if anything, it seems more like an wasted opportunity: Daenerys' portrayal may remain annoyingly wise and saintly, but I will say Kit Harrington does a great job of playing ""tired of this sh*t"". The scene where he warns about the danger in the North is actually quite good - but it could be a lot better. Something is missing, whether it is that the dialogue doesn't contain anything really memorable, or that it somehow feels wrong to focus the danger on the walking dead (the White Walkers seem to me a far scarier enemy but are referenced only in relation to the Night's King, I don't know, it felt a little iffy).That said, one can't help but laugh at how Jon arrives by sea to Dragonstone in about what, a day, since the terrible winds of winter only blow against Stannis and the seas are calm and the skies are clear even in Winterfell.Speaking of Winterfell, Bran Stark comes back and maybe I am prejudiced, but in his dialogue with Sansa at the Godswood he was like some combination of an emo kid (""you can't understand me, sis, no one can, leave me be *ANGST*. It' so hard to explain that someone else was the three-eyed crow before, but now it's me"") and an after- hours radio producer (""and this next....song is for...mmmh, Sansa...who looked so...so pretty in her wedding dress"")In King's Landing, we get a second failed mirror scene. Much like the deplorable reflection of the red wedding from Arya, we get a reflected walk of shame, with Ellaria and Tyene Sand (apparently) taking the role of Cersei - except of course it's cheaper, with the crowd at varying times either angrily throwing vegetables or merrily chanting ""murderess"" while smiling (wat). Then we proceed to Cersei getting her revenge on the Dornish women, which gives Lena Headey a chance to act, but....well, it's supposed to be a dramatic scene, with Ellaria being forced to witness the slow death of her daughter. But no one cares, since Tyene (apparently) Sand, like her sisters, was just an annoying, insultingly written stock character that we couldn't stand. So, yeah, sorry D&D, but your supposed drama is betrayed by your previous heinous crimes.But let's get to the bulk of the episode. In the previous episode, Daenerys lost all her fleet 'except for 2-3 ships'. Now, she has sent another fleet (maybe I missed something, I don't know, but just how many ships did she have, I seem to remember 10 people stealing 100 from Pyke and that's all) to take Casterly Rock - they succeed because of...secret tunnels...(such an exquisitely fresh idea), but it was a trap, as suddenly, Euron's teleporting starfleet appears. Burned the fleet yesterday evening, brought the prisoners to the queen in the morning, burned another fleet by noon - OK, maybe he wasn't actually there for the second battle, but com' on, all these people do journeys that should take months in a couple of hours, have some pity, TV time and all. Not to mention nobody appears capable of noticing a fleet in this show. Invisible fleet at Meereen, check. Invisible fleet attacks Yara, check. Invisible fleet follows the Unsullied, check.Admittedly, ignoring the laughable teleportations, the scheme to abandon Casterly Rock to get Highgarden was clever. Except for the fact that Highgarden is completely undefended, Olenna Tyrell arrived there how the hell exactly (she was in Dragonstone, who took her there? When? How? Did the Unsullied fleet drop her off? Just how quick is it?), Jaime leads another invisible army that the Tyrells simply couldn't possibly notice, and even if you are one of the fans who takes leaps of faith over all these bottomless plot holes, we get zero battles. I repeat, the Lannister stratagem, despite its senseless timeline and its phantom armies, was sort of clever. And instead of creating some suspense out of it, with the Unsullied winning Casterly Rock after a difficult battle only to reveal it was a trap, we get both sieges in ten seconds. Budget reasons, I know, but maybe cut pointless dragon footage?Olenna is given a half-decent farewell, but those of us who have been paying attention can't help but feel sorry for Jaime Lannister. A character who was portrayed from villain to antihero, with his account on why he killed the Mad King being one of the most poignant scenes in the entire series, only for his character development to be reverse engineered back to episode 1 and the things he does for love. After all the previous evolution, nothing he does makes sense. His whole relationship with Brienne, his losing his hand causing Cersei's resentment, his respect for the enemy, it all served a single character goal. To show that he drifts away from his sister. But Benioff and Weiss cancel every single of those plot lines. Why? My guess is so that they show his eventual betrayal as a shocking twist, to the facepalm of millions. Such a shame for Jaime Lannister.As an afterthought, Jorah is completely cured in HALF A DAY. The Archmaester tries to convince a disbelieving audience that yes, this was an extremely dangerous procedure that revered maesters couldn't do properly, but well done, guy who cleans sh*t, you did it.Well acted, well produced, horridly written by two people who should have given creative control and script writing to literally anyone else the moment they ran out of book material, because they utterly suck at it.PS: Olenna and Jaime explaining to the audience the devious Lannister plan we watched in the previous two scenes was really sad and should tell you all you need to know of D&D's target audience."
506," The song is about to begin!
",9,True,"The season just got interesting! Who would have expected things would turn out this way. When Daenerys set out for Westeros at the end of season 6 with allies from Dorne, Iron Islands and Highgarden, who would have thought she would lose them all within two episodes and everything will go into dumpster fire. Daenerys seemed to be the clear winner, with the rest of the bystander kingdoms despising Cersei. Three episodes down and the game has completely changed. Cersei has won the battle so far, defeating and forming ally with Iron Island and Reach. Dorne hangs away.Cersei always enjoys sudden moments of highs. She had an absolute low for the nine episodes of season 6 and then she rocketed her way to glory in the finale. Here again she jumps to top. It's interesting how Tyrion's plans failed even though all we've gotten this season was just throwback and repetition of the master plans that we had seen before. That is disappointing because it shows that Tyrion, as smart as he may be, still isn't smarter than Cersei, regardless of what he had said about her smartness in season 2.Even though Jon-Dany's union was supposed to be the most sought after one, the episode is so delightfully packed with action that it just seems another big piece in the pudding. The meeting of Jon and Daenerys was, thankfully, realistically portrayed instead of doing fan service and quickly throwing them into each other's arms. The song of ice and fire will take some time to start playing. The arguments from both the sides were fun to watch while Tyrion tried to play the role of the mediator. Cersei's revenges are always worth watching, irrespective of whom you are rooting for. The way she gets back at Ellaria (who by the way acted amazingly well this episode), is another great throwback to season 5. Even though she might most certainly still not win the war against Daenerys, it seems interesting what she is planning to do with Euron if the battle is indeed won. He is not going to be fooled to death that easily.It was funny to see how there were in total two battles in this episode and yet they finished both off within 10 minutes. The budget constraint could be one reason. Another being the importance these battles hold in the narrative. As interesting as these battle sequences could have been, their ending was predictable. It's good to see them focusing more on the storyline. Small mistakes aside, one complain that I am having with this season is the pace of the show. It is going too fast now. This leads to thinning down of the plot. Every battle is happening everywhere. It would be better to show them in a complex way rather than continuing to haste it to the end, keeping the audience in the pretence of the same old GoT feels.Special mention - Sansa-Bran reunion. The stark theme always gets you.Foreseeing- Sansa-Bran-Arya reunion is imminent. Probably the next episode will feature that. Jon-Dany bond will strengthen as Dany chooses to fight the battle in the north before heading towards Cersei. Overall, a brilliant episode which concluded a lot of story lines while building up towards finale simultaneously.8.8/10"
507," Tyrion: I trust the eyes of an honest man more than I trust what everybody knows.
",10,True,"The Queen's Justice is a quality episode, with its best characters at the forefront and intertwined.Two heroic leaders in Jon and Daenerys meet and fill the screen with charisma, intensity and purpose, along with some humour assisted by Tyrion and Davos. Cersei has her revenge on the Sand woman and her daughter and sits with the representative of the bank. Cercei terrific this episode. Samwell cures Jorah. The Lannister army trample through the Tyrell's, killing two birds with one stone. To eliminate the enemy's ally and to pay off the substantial debt and fund the war to come.Jon, Cersei, Daenerys and Tyrion the standouts."
508," And now the rains weep o'er our halls
",10,True,"Best episode of the season so far and I truly believe each and every scene in this episode was worth our time. We start off with Jon arriving at Dragonstone, and well regarding that, most of the people were excited for Jon and Dany's confrontation (even though it was great and perfectly written), I was damn excited to see Jon and Tyrion reunite which took us straight back to the first 3 episodes of Season 1 where they had amazing dialogue and they did not disappoint here as well! Coming to the my favorite part of the episode, Cersei truly living up to her name once again in the scene with Ellaria and her daughter as that scene had some great acting and writing. Cruelty at its peak. The third major highlight for me was the end and I am so glad Jamie got some interesting and worthy screen- time as I really like his character (For how it was developed in the first 3 seasons). Lots of other great moments in this episode as well like Sansa and Bran's reunion, Varys and Melisandre's interaction and Littlefinger's dialogue but the Lannisters were on a role here and stole the spotlight. Now that I just realized that the rest of the story would be told in the 10 remaining episodes of this show, I just can't wait to see what happens, well we all can't."
509," Classic game of thrones episode
",10,True,"Latest seasons of GOT lacks smart tactics and brilliant dialogues and these are some of the things I really missed. This episode had it all, and it felt like an early season episode with R.R touch. From the acting to story to production everything was brilliant. This season raise the quality bar from the previous seasons."
510," No space and time concept, everything's a rush
",3,False,"Starting with season 6, this TV show became just a TV show with rushed scenario, cliché dialogues and easy to predict events. Song of Ice and Fire's success was no-rush, creative and very hard to predict, personalized stories. Especially with this last episode, it's easy to see how the quality had dropped to the level of a ""just an American TV show"". There is no space/time concept anymore, everything is happening in a rush, no logic at all. It's like all these locations are next to each other and anybody can go anywhere any time. Thousands of ships of navies are clashing and being destroyed, HighGarden has fallen in a few hours (which is supposed to be the richest and has a big army), Jon Snow is being teleported from The Wall to Dragonstone...HBO is just eating the fruits of first 5 seasons which were based on well thought, well written books, not some TV scenarist."
511," An awkward meeting for potential allies
",9,True,"Jon Snow has sailed to see Daenerys at Dragonstone, against the advice of those close to him, and soon wonders if they were right. Daenerys makes it clear that she is the rightful Queen of the Seven Kingdoms and as such doesn't recognise his kingship of the north... still he must persuade her that it is vital that she helps him in the coming fight against the threat from north of the wall. Back in King's Landing Euron Greyjoy takes his niece, Yara; Ellaria Sand and her daughter Tyene to Cersei so she can have her revenge. Cersei has another visitor; this one from the Iron Bank; she promises that she will repay them soon. At Winterfell Sansa is reunited with Bran. Elsewhere The Unsullied attack Casterly Rock and Jaime's army attacks Olenna Tyrell's home, Highgarden.This was a really fine episode. It provided solid character development, advanced the plot and bid farewell to a favourite character. It was great to see two of the series' protagonists, Daenerys and Jon Snow finally meet; this was handled well with just the right degree of awkwardness; they may both be considered 'good guys' but that doesn't mean they should be friends or even trust each other as each has their own motives. Emilia Clarke and Kit Harington, as Daenerys and Jon, along with Peter Dinklage as Tyrion had impressive scenes together. Lena Headey stood out as we see just how cruel Cersei can be. In other scenes Sophie Turner impressed as Sansa Stark; a character that has improved as the series progressed. Finally Diana Rigg was great as Olenna; her scene with on form Nikolaj Coster-Waldau was top notch. If the episode had any flaws it was the shortness of the battle scenes... although this can be excused as they were meant to be easier than expected for the victors. Overall a really good episode."
512," Back on track - Spoiler-free
",9,True,"I certainly can say that I didn't enjoy last 2 episodes as much as I wanted, but holy this episode changed it, the storytelling, the justice, the turning tables, the look on Jaime's face, it was all in place to make this the best season 7 episode (for now), clearly an outstanding episode. I am very eager to see what is next for both queens, hopefully it won't disappoint"
513," this show has gone way down without the books
",1,False,"Seriously, the ratings here are simply nonsense. I bet most ppl left watching this show are watching it like a rated-R popcorn movie. This show has gone way down ever since they ran out of material from the books. What they know is the ""ENDING"", anybody that contributes nothing to the ending can just be killed without even plotting. The formidable Tyrell army was beaten in a few seconds by the Lannisters who barely won any battle in the past six seasons. They had the money, had the food, and yet they were no use to the ending, thus they were ""canceled"".Same thing with the Dorne, whose leaders were killed without even doing anything important last season, and the ones who kill them were beaten without even doing anything important this season, just because Euron had to win.Oh, and please tell me, anyone, how did those ships travel around the continent like they were flying. How did those lovely characters travel all the way down to Sandstorm from Winterfell in like no time?Nothing makes sense, really. They just want to make everything fit their ""ENDING"", coz they lack the basic ability of storytelling."
514," Back on track
",9,True,"Sometimes we have to help others even if we don't want to. I got an introduction to this kind of help. A remarkable one immediately got some awesome introductions. In this episode, on the one hand, some new relationships came up, while on the other hand, some wrong decisions changed a lot. If you want to burn and ruin someone else's family, then some of your hands will also burn, this is exactly the identity I got behind this incident. If a person from his own family, who was lost a long time ago, suddenly returns, he feels a strange happiness, but with him many questions arise in his mind, the answers to those questions will be found in this episode. An introduction to how an entire dynasty ended little by little can be found in the episode. This episode is really good and thrilling compared to the first episode."

517," With intelligent interaction and even more superb writing, this episode exceeded my expectations
",10,True,"The Queen's Justice continues the seventh season in the best way possible. It delivered what everyone including fans of the book series wanted including the long-awaited meeting between Daenerys and Jon. The pacing is great and doesn't drag even if it's around an hour and the directing/editing continues to be solid. The performances continue to be terrific as well with Kit Harrington and Emilia Clarke during the interaction of Jon Snow and Queen Daenerys along with the final performances of Diana Rigg, Rosabell Laurenti Sellers and Indira Varma as Olenna Tyrell, Tyene Sand, and Ellaria Sand. Especially when Olenna confessed that she was the one who killed Joffrey after she drinks poisoned wine and the two ladies of the Sand who got captured by Euron Greyjoy and given to Cersei Lannister as gifts to their marriage once their war is won. Ramin Djawadi continues to deliver in his beautiful score and fitted really well. And finally, the bait-and-switch scene concerning Casterly Rock and Highgarden which is also well-written. Overall this is another great episode and the seventh season continues to be even more compelling."

Its not linked to book anymore but can someone explain how can someone lead to kings landing without passing dragonisland, and probably they invented teleportation. Fleet appears suddenly on casterly rock. they don't even look at the map. so many irrational events. Many great wars happened in three episodes and none of them makes any sense How can you defeat highgarden??Just look at the map of GoT. Hopefully some of the screenwriter sees but looks like its too late.. Of course there are a lot of eyecandies and super quotes but...."

",9,True,"Jon Snow and Sir Davos travel to Dragonstone to meet Daenerys. Jon asks for help to Daenerys to fight the White Walkers but in the position of the King of the North and not a minion. Daenerys ""invites"" Jon and Davos to stay in her house but the diplomatic Tyrion wisely advises Daenerys to give dragon glass to Jon to show good faith to him. Meanwhile Euron brings Ellaria Sand and her daughter Tyene and gives them to Cercei that revenges Myrcella's death. Sansa is worried with the supplies for the coming war and surprisingly meets her brother Bran at Winterfell. Grey Worm and the unsullied army attack Casterly Rock and have a surprise. Samwell heals Jorah at the Cidatel.""The Queen's Justice"" is so far the best episode of the Seventh Season of Game of Thrones. The dialogues are sharp and witty with great participation of Daenerys, Jon Snow, Tyrion and Cercei. The different tactics adopted by the Machievellian Cercei and Daenerys to win the war are impressive. The subplots are also very interesting. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""The Queen's Justice"""
520," This episode is on fire
",10,True,"Easily just as great as the Battle of the Bastards and The Winds of Winter. Action packed from the beginning to the end. It will be hard for the following episodes to compare to this one. If they are remotely close or better, we are in full a ride for the rest of the season. Can't wait till the next episode, to see how this is going to play out. The spoils of war is only 50 minutes, what are the hour + episodes are going to bring? 10/10 easily"
521," Absolutely Phenomenal - Top 5 Episode
",10,True,"Season 7 has continued its streak of consistently improving every episode. But I doubt that any of us expected for an episode 4 of Game of Thrones to stand as one of the top 5 episodes of all time.Everything was perfect. A breathtaking installment.The Winterfell storyline was amazing this time around. Bran's characterization seems to be consistent, and Meera's acknowledgment to the new developments in his character helped us further understand the impacts of becoming the Three Eyed Raven. Littlefnger, despite somewhat lacking of his typical plotting proficiency, is still playing the game of thrones behind the scenes. As if he's attempting to influence all the Starks to momentarily doubt his capricious nature and then instantly turn all of the siblings on each other. Arya's homecoming has been long awaited and was everything I expected it to be and more. The parallels to season 1 were heavy in this one, and the emotional reunion in the crypts was great. We remember that Arya and Sansa couldn't be more different - like ice and fire - yet they are now mature enough to coexist and embrace each other as family, which is really beautiful to see. Finally, the Arya vs. Brienne scene was absolutely fantastic. If anyone felt that Arya's storyline was a waste the last two seasons, they shouldn't feel that way anymore. She's become the most deadly assassin in Westeros, and remarkably one of the best fighters too.In Dragonstone, Jon takes Daenerys into the cave to show her the dragonglass mine. First of all, the score couldn't get any better. Ramin Djawadi nails the soundtrack for every scene in every episode, but this, in particular, added so much more emphasis on to the scene. Due to the ancient carvings in the walls made by the Children of the Forest, Dany seems to be less skeptical of the White Walker threat. We see her momentarily bring down her walls for Jon and drop her Queenly tone in what is likely one of my favorite Game of Thrones scenes of all time. It reminds us that despite all of her character development and life-altering moments, Daenerys is still the same person at heart that she was in Episode 1. Kit and Emilia have some definite chemistry together, and their scenes together have been nothing short of extraordinary. Daenerys also seems to develop some trust, if not attraction, in Jon, and relies on him in front of her counsel to provide advice on her military tactics.Despite Dragonstone and Winterfell having their best scenes all season, the real outstanding moment of this episode lies with Jaime and Bronn. It is a pleasure to see Ser Bronn of the Blackwater back in Game of Thrones. His banter with Jaime demonstrated some terrific writing and his one-liners have proved to still make us laugh. While transporting the gold plundered from Highgarden to King's Landing, Daenerys attacks on Drogon with her Dothraki at her front. King Robert's notions about the Dothraki in open fields proved true, as this was an absolute slaughter. Tyrion's still evident care for his family, Jaime's paralleling of Dany and the Mad King, Bronn's perfect emulation of the sellsword fighting style, and the best dragon action in Game of Thrones history comes together to create a battle that rivals the Battle of the Bastards. Ramin Djawadi, once again, absolutely shined, and Matt Shakman proved to be just as capable as the legendary Miguel Sapochnik. Bravo once again, HBO. I adored every second of it. The shortest episode in Game of Thrones history has proved to be one of the greatest. Season 7 has been phenomenal, delivering the strongest first half to a season in Game of Thrones history."
522," One of the greatest episodes in Game of Thrones!
",10,True,"The Spoils of War is one of the finest episodes in Game of Thrones and the most explosive one since Hardhome from season 5. The first three episodes of the season were something of a setup for the mini-climax that this episode provides.This episode marks the return of Arya in Winterfell and the reunion of the Stark siblings. Moreover, it provides a great take-on on Brienne by Arya that showcases her amazing skills with the sword as well as her skills as a faceless assassin. Littlefinger's encounter with Bran is also fascinating and indicates the beginning of the end for his schemes. Littlefinger is one of the greatest players participating in the Game of Thrones and a man who is three steps ahead of everyone and anticipates everything, but he couldn't have anticipated Bran's knowledge as the Three-Eyed Raven.Daenerys has been waiting for some time now in Dragonstone, as the Lannister army and Euron Greyjoy's fleet continue to wreak havoc on her allies and even the successful conquest of Casterly Rock by the Unsullied army, proves to be an excellent strategic move by Jaime and Cersei to mislead them. She finally decides to take matter into her own hands and announce her arrival in Westeros by attacking Jaime and his army with Drogon and the Dothraki army, thus providing us with one of the best battle scenes in the whole series and arguably the highlight of the season. The direction and cinematography of the battle is impeccable, as it is gorgeously filmed and displays an excellent color palette throughout the whole duration, it's exquisitely choreographed, the atmosphere is very intense and emotional and moreover the multiple points of view of the characters are fascinating. There is a handheld longshot featuring Bronn making his way across the battlefield which resembles the two-minute Jon Snow's 'Fog of War' sequence in Battle of the Bastards, that is just magnificent at making us feel like we are there alongside the characters of the show fighting. There is also an incredible sequence that is inspired by the opening of Saving Private Ryan and some awe-inspiring sequences in Come and See, when the real sound collapses into oblivion and we focus in the shock of the commander Jaime Lannister, as he surveys the field of carnage brought by the attack, thus providing us with an interesting parallel between Daenerys' actions & motives and the Mad King's actions & motives.The devastation that Drogon brings on the battlefield reminds me of the helicopter and napalm attack from Apocalypse Now. Also, the POV shots of Daenerys on Drogon's back are very similar to that of the helicopters in Apocalypse Now. This creative decision by David Benioff and D.B. Weiss indicates what they are trying to say about Daenerys' invasion on Westeros. Just like the U.S. intervention against the Vietcong, Daenerys and her lieutenants justify their war against Cersei Lannister as the moral overthrow of a tyrannical regime. But what results in both cases is the indiscriminate slaughter of the people who see themselves fighting against a foreign occupation. This is no small point as George R.R. Martin was a conscientious objector to the conflict in Vietnam. He wrote TSOIAF books to critique the horrors of war among many other things. I can see Daenerys' arc going down the same chaotic, self-defeating, and destructive path as the one the United States took in Vietnam.On a visual level, this episode is a masterpiece. The scenery is as breathtaking as it is spectacular, the sets are truly beautiful & hugely atmospheric with a meticulous eye for detail, the practical and VFX team has done an incredible job with the visual effects as everything looks incredibly realistic and finally the costumes are some of the best I've ever seen on the small screen. The writing of the episode is one of the most thematically layered, nuanced, passionate and thought-provoking of Game of Thrones and the score is as great as ever. In conclusion this episode is one of the best episodes in Game of Thrones as it has one of the finest battles of the whole series. Has incredible direction &, cinematography, marvelous writing that advances the storyline and great pacing & editing that keep the audience absorbed throughout the whole length, leaving them craving for the next episode."
523," Spoils of War - 10/10
",10,True,"I had some problems with the first 2 episodes of this season, especially Dragonstone, but Queen's justice and this episode have delivered what I was expecting from this show, as a fan of both the TV show and the books. I understand that the writing of D&D is not as good as George Martin, but I think the level of the TV show has gotten so high, that even poor writings in some episodes can't effect the whole thing. I still think Game of Thrones is one of the best shows ever created and season 7 in my opinion is better than seasons 5 & 6. But let's talk about this episode. I found the scenes in Winterfell quite beautiful. We got why Bran is acting weird, according to Meera, he died in that cave and an emotionless raven was born. Also, it was cool to see the reunion of stark sisters who were mean to each other in the 1st season. I think the fans deserve some moments of peace and happiness between these characters who suffered a lot from the beginning. The scenes at dragonstone were also good. We got a jon snow/theon greyjoy reunion. but the most important thing is that I feel like they're preparing everything for the alliance of jon and daenerys. I'm one of the people who are against any kind of marriage or love between these 2, but the thing is that even if these sorts of things happen, they totally make sense. Finally, Daenerys's attack was anticipated but the end of it was not predictable at all. We had never seen dragon attack in this scale; the visual effects and the music made the scenes more exciting and more enjoyable. overall, it was a great episode with magnificent action. Can't wait for the final three."
524," I Will Fight For You
",10,True,"What seemed to start of slow, has now picked up and gotten expectedly great the last few weeks. We knew season 7 was going to have a quicker pace and a clearer purpose, but I didn't expect this much to happen this fast. There have now been quite a few battles this season, and not one of them have seen both sides come prepared. It's going to be interesting to see how things will shake out when both Cersei and Dany have their armies ready. Or maybe because we've gotten so many battles already, the fight for the Throne will be quiet and quick? Unlikely, but I wouldn't put it past Dave and Dan. In all, The Spoils of War was quite the episode.It's weird to think yet another Stark reunion will take second or third fiddle to the rest of the episode's events, but guys Arya finally made it back to Winterfell! I'm starting to think Winterfell will be the home to quite a few main characters once Jon makes it back and The Hound fights off his demons. Who knows, maybe even Melisandre will make her way to Winterfell. She did tell Arya she'll see her again someday. Anyways, I enjoyed the Arya and Sansa reunion, but not for the reasons I suspected. The tension between them shouldn't be unexpected at all, considering they've never been that close, but for some reason I expected something else. However, seeing Arya begin to train with Brienne was a sight to see. Some really well choreographed sword fighting and camera tricks fooled me, because it sure looked like Maisie Williams was doing all her own stunts. Bran continues to be a frustrating character. I feel like there could have been a way to portray his transformation into the Three-eyed- Raven a little bit more poignant. Instead, he feels like a monotone creep. Perhaps when he gets that Targaryen secret off his chest he'll cool down. But hey, Littlefinger's Valyrian Steel dagger was passed onto Bran and then to Arya, so I guess his presence was worth it, right?At the beginning of the episode I wrote down in my notes ""when will the tables turn back to Daenerys' side?"", well I think I got my answer. After Dany received more cautionary advice from Jon, she decided to take back control of the war by wiping out most of the Lannister army with Drogon and the Dothraki. It's hard to beat the pulse-pounding and emotional 'Battle of the Bastards' last year, but they sure did their best to outdo themselves once again. Everything from the screams of the Dothraki army to the breathtaking cinematography of Dany riding Drogon into battle. Pitting her against Jaime and Bronn made it increasingly difficult who to root for. Perhaps the only downside was that nobody significant died. There was a part of me that thought Bronn may meet his end, or even Drogon/Jaime. Heck, they were teasing a queen-slayer moment for Jaime. Does that give us any hint that Cersei may meet her end that way? Regardless, the tension was masterfully directed. One of the best battles this show has ever given us.The other main talking point will probably be the increasing romantic tension between Dany and Jon. It may be awkward and weird, but it's not like either of them know Jon's true parentage, so for now it's harmless. For those who doubt the show will ever go that route, I don't think they would have Daavos ask Jon what he thought about her & include Dan and Dave discussing both of their attractions toward each other in the ""inside the episode"" segment. Whether you like it or not, the show is going that route. Oh and by the way, Dany casually mentions that she will fight for Jon in the war for the dawn. Hell yeah.+Queen-slayer+Romantic tension+THAT battle+Cinematography & choreography+Another Stark reunion10/10"
525," WHOAA !!! Jawdropping episode !! Could this get any better ?
",10,True,"Again, GOT has done it again ladies and gentlemen. And We thought that we could never have an episode as epic as Battle Of The Bastards or Winds Of Winter, but hell we were wrong, GOT has given us another phenomenal episode. The Spoils Of War, the episode gave us everything we've ever wanted since the first season.The episode starts where it ended last week, Jaime Lannister and his forces heading back to king's landing filled with gold so that Cersei can pay her dept to the iron bank.In the north, things are getting serious, bran and LF had their first meeting, with LF playing his filthy games as always. Meera has left bran and she went home, the scene were she said goodbye to Bran was heartbreaking, after all what she done for him, she didn't get the farewell she deserves, and we learned that the real Brandon Stark died in the cave, he's changed now, i guess being a Three eyed raven isn't that easy. Arya has finally came home, she reunited with her siblings, she got a Valyrian steel dagger from Bran, and we saw a duel fight between her and Brienne, GOD that was one hell of a fight, we can confirm now that Arya is a high skilled assassin.In King's Landing, Cersei is making her next moves, she got the iron bank by her side, she's willing to hire the golden company in Essos to fight her her.In Dragonstone, things are pretty intense, Jon and Dany are getting along, she's starting to believe that the real threat lies beyond the wall ,dany promised that she will fight for Jon and the north if he bends the knee. she even asked for his advice about what she should do. The best part of the episode took place at the last 15 minutes, Dany has took Drogon, her Dothraki and she went to strikes the Lannisters back .. And that battle, OMFG that battle, after Miguel Sapochnik's masterpiece ""Battle Of The Bastards"", Matt Shakman has delivered us another masterpiece, ""Field Of Fire v.2"", one of the greatest battles the TV has ever seen. It was visceral, cinematic and incredibly thrilling and it showed us the horrors of war in such a brutal and stunning way. i was shaking during the whole sequence, so many artistic scenes. The visual effects were beyond perfect i don't even know how to describe it, really it was literally perfect. the soundtrack was breathtaking as always, unbelievable work by Ramin Djawadi. So, The Spoils Of War has earned the hype, leaving us hungry for more. Season 7 is turning out to be the best season in GOT so far, with only 4 episodes, GOT has already gave us too much. Can't wait for the next upcoming episodes9.9/10"
526," Hell Fire (minor spoilers)
",10,True,"A tremendous episode! It features a rather interesting and rather intimate moment between Jon and Daenerys. An unexpected and quite entertaining action sequence also occurs between Arya and Brienne. And Jon Snow encounters still another familiar face.But this episode will mostly be remembered for the simply amazing battle at the end.The spectacular and horrific battle sequence had me on the edge of my seat. Never have so many of our favorite characters been placed in so much peril-- including the dragon. The epic battle scene was both astonishingly beautiful and shocking as soldiers on both sides fall victim to the cruelty of war from the ground and from the air.Ironically, in an earlier conversation, Bronn discusses the myth of the 'glory' of war. Unfortunately,his point is suddenly illustrated when he and Jaime suddenly find themselves enveloped in an absolutely terrifying battle which will probably psychologically scar these characters for life-- if they survive:-)"
527," Loved it.
",10,True,"I knew Game of Thrones was good, and I slowly became a fan recently, but I was reserved in how much of a fan I was...until tonight. I now officially love the show. Anyone who has not seen it yet and who are only watching shows like the Walking Dead are missing out. This is the Walking Dead on steroids and much much better. It's a great show. This is the moment so many have waited for for years. Let's hope they can keep them coming like this."
528," Dracarys
",10,True,One of the finest episodes of GOT. This episode just raised the expectation. Previous 3 episodes keep cersei ahead but mother of dragon took one episode to make it equal or go ahead. This episode surely a good execution of story line. Let's see what happens to the next episode. Expecting more from episode 5.

",10,True,"Well, this episode goes right at the top of the list for this season and among the top ones across all seasons.The winter fell sequence is so emotionally satisfying and you would definitely be touched by the scenes there.Well, coming to the title - 'Spoils of War', this war sequence is treat for your eyes. No words are enough to thank the writers, producers and directors of this show who bring us such magnanimous display on the TV. All I can say is when the war sequence ended, my heart was pumping hard and my body was shivering. You got to see it to feel it!"
531," Game of Thrones is Still the Best Thing on Television.
",10,True,"The Spoils of War is easily the best episode of Season Seven thus far. While the last few episodes have been very good, they've felt a little lacking in comparison to the previous seasons. Not this one though. Spoils has some of the best, most exciting and well-directed moments in the Game of Thrones canon.The fights are amazing and the battle we actually see take place is powerful; and the conclusion of the fight emphasizes how allegiances in war are a costly thing when the side is not the right one to choose. Tyrion didn't want Jaime to run charging at Daenerys like a 'fucking idiot', and even though they're brothers on opposite sides of a war, you don't want to see either of them come to harm. They're simply in a fight they want to see come to a not-so-bitter end.Spoils of War is another great and massively important chapter in Game of Thrones."
532," Masterpiece
",10,True,"Game of Thrones remains a masterpiece, as always !!! Best Serie ever!!!"
533," The Best Episode of Season 07.
",10,True,"When I was watching Season 07 I saw there is so much logicless things in serie. Most of them are was in Winterfell. It was between Arya and Sansa. They were talking like they hate each other when no one is watching or listening them. Why they talking like they are enemies when no one is watching? That was real nonsense. But season finale and this episode was really good to compare Season 8. This episode is real good, it is the best episode of S07."
534," Breathtaking!
",10,True,"Strangely this episode is the shortest of this season and one of the shortest of GoT so far. But it compensates with the very good story and some of the best sequences ever in GoT. And since this episode leaked on the Web, I'll try as much as I can to make this review as spoiler-free as possible.This is one of those episodes that just gets better as the episode progresses. At the beginning there are scenes that in a way just makes this episode pick up where the previous left off with Jamie talking to Bronn about his reward and Bran back at Winterfell giving Littlefinger and old reference he once told Varys some seasons ago. This episode just shows how much Bran has changed since he's now ""The three Eyed raven"" pointed out by a dialogue scene with Meera.Then as the episode progressed nothing much happened at Winterfell until Arya's arrival which gets the plot going from there. There are some good moments especially between her and Brienne which showcases how much she's come along as a fighter and also as an assassin.From there the episode goes to the most interesting place in this episode, Dragonstone. And the plot there unlike last episode moves on very well making slowly out of Daenerys a believer in the Walkers. There is a scene you might see it coming, I was expecting it, that reveals things from the past battles of men and children against white walkers. And then there is a scene that just develops the relationship between Jon and Danny even more to the point where you think Danny agrees easily to help Jon. But things aren't so simple with the stubborn ""Mother of Dragons"".There are also some dialogues between Daavos and Jon that showcases what Jon feels for Daenerys. And there's another scene that explores what Tyrion told Jon last episode about asking other people what they think of the ""Mad King""'s daughter. There's another tense moment between Daenerys and her advisers which is settled by Jon with a very mature speech to her, making Danny realize for herself what her next move in this war should be. Then there's a scene by the shores of Dragonstone which by what the photos released by HBO this week have shown involves another reunion that's not as good as the Stark reunion at Winterfell.And then of course is the last 10 minutes which I won't spoil, because there some of the very best moments ever shown in GoT, a moment you might have expected and also a face-off that most of us longed to see it. The episode ends with a classic cliffhanger finish for the episode that will leave you wanting the next episode so bad.To wrap up, I'll summarize all into this: This episode proves again that this season is one of the best seasons ever in GoT with great storytelling and breathtaking action that in my opinion comes close(speaking of this episode) to the Battle of Bastards.10/10"
535," Easily one of the best episodes of the show.
",10,True,"I can't begin to describe how thrilled I am to see GoT in it's former glory of unpredictability, albeit with some big plot holes. I'll start off with the one big issue season 7 has. Timing. They're literally taking such huge time leaps that it becomes unconvincing, if not too convenient. Dany dropping on High Garden just moments after igniting the sparks between herself and Jon seems unsettling.But that doesn't mean it wasn't entertaining. Every single storyline was at its best. Just when I thought Ep 3 might be the mid-season peak, Ep4 comes leaking forward. I remember finding myself unable to digest how tables turned upon Daenerys even though she had the strongest case at the beginning of S7. But one must not mistake her silence to be her weakness. But more on that later.-The episode kicks off with the Tyrell gold being packed off to King's Landing. Jaime is sulking over his dilemmas and learning his lessons like the tragic bad guy that he is.-Arya returns! Arya has really grown to be one of the most interesting characters this season. Her return to home will leave you teary- eyed. Her fighting expertise was breathtaking. We see another throwback this episode with Arya being turned away by the guards at the gate of winterfell, a lot like she had been at King's Landing back in season 1. Also, let's not forget ""Chaos is a ladder"", which is not merely a throwback but also a warning to Baelish.-Bran 's storyline is the only one that seems sloppy to me at the moment. He is the three-eyed-raven. He knows some important facts that he must inform Sansa. He can start with how Baelish betrayed Ned. He is fully aware of how Baelish is constantly trying to get into Sansa 's head. Maybe a little warning would do. I don't see a reason why he needs to wait for Jon's return to do so, except for the reason of packing season finale with every big info possible.-Jon and Dany is going to happen. Jon is interested, Davos will tell you that. Dany needs some reacquaintance with love. Jon discovers how Dany has been chosen by her people just as much as he has been chosen by his. Both have earned their names.-Now the best part. Timeline jumps to weeks later and Jaime is lazily taking his troops to King's Landing, unaware of the screamers and fire emitting beasts coming his way. If you thought Hardhome was mesmerising, wait till you see the giant dragon flying through the air with his wings wide open covering a large chunk of screaming Dothraki hordes. This is easily the best battle scene ever directed on Game of Thrones. The amount of CG used on this pays off. Dany alone finishes off half the Lannister army. Thus episodes throws fan armies into battle. Jaime Vs Dany and Tyrions dilemma through all of this shows pretty much how neutral fans must be feeling.Overall, this episode approaches perfection as much as it could with the minor fixable plot-holes. Hopefully, they will fix the misses soon.9.5/10."

",10,True,"""spoiler alert""This episode is one of the shortest of GOT so far. But it compensates with the very good story and some of the best sequences ever in GoT, and one of the best episodes.This is one of those episodes that just gets better as the episode progresses.

This episode just shows how much Bran has changed since he's now ""The three Eyed raven"" pointed out by a dialogue scene with Meera.Then as the episode progressed nothing much happened at Winterfell until Arya arrived, i played the scene of Arya's fight over and over, i'm really amazed how she got that progress and stunning performance, however i kinda felt that she still that little girl with that silly smile, but overall she has great performance. There are some good moments especially between her and Brienne which shows how much she came along as a fighter and also as an assassin. for Daenerys, GOT is all about that scene between Jon and Daenerys, that little facial expression for both and that short romance, completely makes you forget everything happened and what would come next, and you wish that nothing goes wrong. that silly smile and Daenerys moves step toward Jon really will make you wish that they end up in a romantic scene.and you realize that Tyrion might not be that wise in the art of war, they lost it, and then she asked Jon what should i do? i'm losing the war..you really love that Ice and Fire! the last 10 minutes was one of the very best moments ever shown in GoT, a moment you might have expected and also a face-off that you really wanted to see it from a long time, to see The Mother of Dragons ""being a dragon"". and on the other side of Tyrion you see that horror from dragons flames, and seeing that much of cruelty, makes you feel for these solders, the same look mixed with fear of the Dothrakeys and how savage they are, and all that emotions got boosted up after one of the Dothrakies said "" your people cant fight"", and fear for his brother Jamie, and the same goes for Jamie, he was scared once he heard the sound of approaching dragon he heard that sound for the first time; what would you expect?, he was scared till the end, and once he got maned up, he approached Khalese desperately trying to kill her with the spare, while she's helping her big dragon, who defended her with his flames, and all that scene was been watched from up hell from Tyrion saying "" you damn fool"" The episode ends classically, which really leaves you wanting the next episode so badly."
537," The Best Battle episode
",10,True,"This was the best battle episode in game of thrones,similar to BOB But the main difference was the climax at the end,Tensions were high and at the end of the episode,we were left in ahuge suspense as to what happened to jaimie.That how you end an episode."
538," Epicness at its glory
",10,True,"This show is always paying off with great build ups and stunning explosions of epicness. I love it and i hate people watching it being close minded and have expectations of a 5 year-old. Game of thrones is a mix of politics, drama, emotion, a reasonable touch of fantasy AND action. Not ONLY action, it would be boring as f* , it is about plot, character development, mystery and some incredible spikes of glorious action, always as breathtaking as it could be. And lets begin: -The Lannisters carrying the ""spoils of war"" back to KL. Great scenery shots and Bronn humorous as always. I liked the discreet irony of the conversation between Cersei and Tycho about the gold foreshadowing Danny's attack. -Back at Winterfell. Arya arrives home at last, humorous scene including the guards mixing your heartwarming emotions with some smiles. The Arya-Sansa-Bran reunion brings back some season 1 memories (Ned's tomb) keeping your emotion-meter high and the conversation between Petter and Bran gives you the chills, i think Littlefinger got his warning both from Bran and Arya starring at him fiercely after her sparring. And oh man, this sparring! Speechless... -Jon and Danny in the cave. Once again your spine feels chilly as the scene unfolds with the Children & First Men against the WW written on the stone. Jon's speech is to the point and Daenerys' reaction exciting. You can notice a spark being born between our two major characters. -Aaaand lets get to the main event. Field of Fire 2.0! Once again this show drops your jaw and accelerates your heartbeats to the maximum. Danny on Drogon and the Dothraki Horde charge at Jaimie's unprepared army. The music, the shots, the CGI, Jaimie's face when he sees Drogon, every single frame is gorgeous! I think my heart was about to stop when Danny said ""Dracarys"" and Drogon DEMOLISHED the Lannister-phalanx giving an opening for the cavalry to charge in. Every detail was worth noticing, people keep saying why Drogon kept on burning the wagons and not the soldiers, well if you are not 5yearsold you can see that the Dothraki were all around mixed with the lannister soldiers in a battle chaos and Danny has her friendly-fire setting probably switched off. But oh man the graphics and the shots were delivering to you the horror of the burning field and the CGI was totally worth all of that budget. You could quickly realize that this wasn't even a battle, it was a slaughter! As for Drogon being hit, damn, i cried my ass off, but it was beautifully done! Drogon's cry, the music and Danny's worry trying to pull the arrow from his wing was filling the place with tears. Excellent directory, just pure beauty! I hope Jaimie is OK despite of being stupid charging at Drogon and his mother.."
539," Chaos isn't a pit, Chaos is a ladder.
",9,True,"This Episode marks the satisfying reunion of Arya and Sansa. Bran poetically says he knows all about little finger with a single line. What an actor Kit Harrington is turning out to be, especially in this season when he represents whole northerners pride. Daenerys loses her patience and rightfully advised by Tyrion to calm down for the sake of innocent people. In the end Show's best actor Peter Dinklage reveals his class by his expressions whether to care for his brother or to serve for the queen in the best way. Overall, It creates big hype for upcoming episodes."
540," Epic
",10,True,"This was the episode we have longed for this season and finally Game of Thrones has delivered. This show beautifully and perfectly captures battle scenes and the camera-work is really well done. We saw a showdown and collision of worlds we have waited long to see. The battle scene between Daenery's and the Dothraki vs the Lannister forces is arguably one of the best moments in this series. Seeing a dragon wipe out Lannister forces in Westoros was truly satisfying. Like many fans I watched the final moments in awe as I shuddered at who would die. This show has bluntly wiped out big characters in an instant. When we saw Jaimie go for Daenerys it looked like a major character would die but the show beautifully gave us a stalemate with both surviving. This episode got everything right from a great opening, dialogues, reunions at Winterfell to an epic battle. Jaimie's expression as he sunk into the Ocean was the same expression I had as I tried to fathom what just happened in the last 10 minutes.Thank you is what I want to say for a breathtaking episode. I can only wait in great anticipation for the next episode."
541," The Episode that Every Fan Was Waiting for
",10,True,"Jon Snow gets closer to Daenerys and shows his discovery in the dragon glass mine. Tyrion advises Daenery and she asks Jon to give his advice, and he tells that she must be a fair queen and not attack and burn the houses of the common people. Meanwhile Arya returns to Winterfell and reunites to Sansa and Bran. Jaime's army and Bron are looting House Tyrell and their lands when they have a surprise.""The Spoils of War"" is the episode that every fan of GOT was waiting for. The story is intense, all the segments are interesting and the battle scene is spectacular. One of the best of the whole series. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""The Spoils of War"""
542," Family reunions and an intense battle
",10,True,"After the events of the previous episode the Lannisters have the funds to repay the Iron Bank; if Jaime can get it back to King's Landing. Arya arrives at Winterfell and is finally reunited with Sansa and Brandon. At Dragonstone John finds the dragon glass and once again asks Daenerys to help in the upcoming battle in the north; he also advises her not to attack the Red Keep... that doesn't mean she isn't going to attack the Lannister forces elsewhere.I've enjoyed season seven so far but this episode manages to take things to another level. It started well with the first half being dominated by the reunion of Arya and Sansa. These scenes were suitably handled; at first the guards try to deny Arya access to Winterfell; then when she tells Sansa about her list of people she intends to kill her sister is mildly amused... until she sees what an accomplished fighter Arya has become when she spars with Brienne. Maisie Williams, Sophie Turner and Gwendoline Christie are great in these scenes. As good as that was there was better to come as Jaime and the Lannister army are attacked by the Dothraki horde and Daenerys, who is riding a dragon. This was one of the best battle sequences to date; it started gradually as first a gentle rumble was heard; it quickly built to a crescendo as battle commences and Daenerys's dragon burnt dozens of opposing soldiers when close combat lead to the sort of mayhem one would expect... it had the intensity one would expect from a big budget Hollywood movie rather than a mid-season TV episode. I have no idea how the series will follow up this episode but look forward to finding out."
543," Holey ... sweet ... Jesus!
",10,True,"Move over Battle of the Bastards, The Spoils of War has officially taken over your mantle as the greatest Game of Thrones episode to date. It is not just the outstanding battle that takes place later in the episode, but the small character moments that will put a wide smile on any fans face.While we are way ahead of the books, I think the creators have done an outstanding job in keeping with the tone of George R R Martins novels, even if the timelines jump and muddle around a bit, but that is understandable considering we only have 7 episodes this season. The scenes at Winterfell were some of the best in the entire season. When Arya walked up to the gates, I felt myself going numb. She's finally home. And her reunion with Sansa was such a powerful scene, they have always been so different, and yet they had been through similar suffering over the course of their stories. Seeing the Stark children once again, something we haven't seen since season 1, was just emotional. And we have to talk about how awesome Arya has become at swordplay. Even though it was just a parrying session, you got the feeling she would be a kick ass assassin. But I hope they don't shove her into battle. The scenes in King's Landing are more or less the same, but short this time around. Cersei as usual is scheming, and the Iron Bank as we already know are a bunch of greedy C ... you get it. But at Dragonstone we get one of the most beautiful scenes in the entire show. When Jon Snow and Dany walk through the Dragonglass cave, and see the markings of the ancient beings of Westeros, I was dazed by it all. They are setting up a relationship between the two, something that I am actually wanting to see. I know some don't, considering ... well they're family. But I try not to think on that. What I also love about the Dragonstone scenes, is that despite Dany's overly confident mind, she isn't a battle commander, neither is Tyrion, in a matter of fact, Dany doesn't have someone to advise her in terms of war - just imagine if she did. The part where she asks Jon for advice, and gets a brilliant response from him, was a perfectly executed scene, showing that she does have flaws.Now for the part everyone will be talking about for weeks to come, unless the next episodes manage to top it all off, is the freaking battle scene. First of all we get some brilliant slick lines from Bronn, and how good it was to see him. Everything seems fine and dandy, until he tilts his head to the sound of thundering hooves. I knew what was going to happen, but couldn't help myself from gasping as the Dothraki appeared over the hills. I was like something out of Lord of the Rings, but with a more heart pounding feeling. Then it happens ... Holey ... F**king Jesus! When Drogon blasted out of the clouds, sending out a spine-tingling roar, I had goosebumps from head to toe. It was simply freaking epic!The cinematography, the music, the visuals, everything was brilliant about this scene. We finally get to see what a dragon can do in battle, and that was only one of them. The effects on the dragon and fire were real, they had to be, because I could not see any CGI in any of those scenes. One of the greatest shots in this entire show happens when Drogon burns a whole load of the Lannisters, and this short scene slows down a little, just to show us how big and awesome he is.I also loved his important Bronn was here, I did at first think he was doing to die, but the episode leaves that hanging. But when he launched the huge arrow into Drogon, I couldn't believe it. I was glad that it didn't kill it, but also glad Drogon didn't kill him either. Damn you Game of Thrones! You are pitting great things against each other.This is an almost perfect episode in every sense of the word. There are minor issues, like how the episode ends, I didn't like that too much. But my bigger complaint is this ... why weren't people more shocked to see Drogon? Sure Jamie and Bronn had wide eyes, but I want you to put yourself in their shoes. Your standing in a large field, the sun is burning hot, there are thousands of Dothraki warriors coming to kill you, then suddenly a 100 foot dragon shoots out of the sky. You are going to say ""F**k this!"" and run like hell! I wanted people to scream, crap themselves, pee themselves, scatter like sheep at the very sight of him. But all this can be ignored, because the episode is just too great.10/10"
544," The difference between having source material and making TV show
",5,False,"This episode along with this season and the last episodes of season 6 is the perfect example of when Script writers are left to their own imagination to write the story of a progressing series.With the first seasons, we get to see amazing television show, with some of the most gripping and twisting story telling. The show showed us that every action has a repercussion. Ned Stark wanted to be noble and Honorable, got captured and killed, Rob betrayed Frey's and we know what happened to him.But now that the show has surpassed the books, the writers are back to writing just typical television where the main characters are invulnerable from their stupid choices. Jaime rides against a dragon, and miraculously escapes not just the fire but capture as well. How does he swim underwater for miles while wearing chain mail, armor and his 20 pound hand? how did he not drown? or get caught by the dothraki? But fine, what about the easy way out that they show Little finger leading Arya? in the past it was done very subtle and not to in the audience face. If you didn't see it, well to bad you missed it. Now its ""Hey, look at this. Do you like how we connect the dots for you?""Why bother watching if everything is put on a plate for you? where the characters travel thousand miles in 5 minutes. Do you remember how first season, you would have 2 episodes of just Brann, and Arya and you are just waiting to see what happens to the others one, but they don't show everyone in the same episode? yeah me too."
545," Very weak
",3,False,"How can an episode like this get a mean of 9 is beyond my understanding. This episode has lots of major flaws and it's full of illogical events. Everything felt rushed and messy. Starting from the little creek into which Jamie and Bronn dived at the end of last episode (one of the most ridiculous cliffhangers I ever saw on screen), which shortly after (at the beginning of this episode) turned out to be an abysmal river, at least five meters deep and so impetuous to take the two guys some miles away in apnea (maybe, did they have some emergency oxygen cylinders inside their armors?).So, the start was rather childish to say the least. But what followed was no better. Tyrion's plan (to capture a wight to persuade Cersei of the ice threat) is absurd and makes no sense. Cersei, with no army, no allies, no lands, is by no means a threat anymore and has no force to add to an anti-dead alliance. Why on earth to care for her with such an absurd plan?The blitz in King's Landing (Davos and Tyrion) looked really cartoonish, from landing of the boat to the end, especially the encounter with Jaime (they did not dare to show us the dialogue). Also Gendry's return felt forced with really poor script.Jon petting and caressing Drogon was, to be honest, embarrassing.Also Winterfell was not convincing: the dialogues between Arya and Sansa were poorly written, the chase between Arya and Littlefinger (her sneaking into his room, the small paper in the mattress, etc.) was, once again, not adult storytelling.Also annoying is the current speed of characters' displacements, which has become essentially instantaneous. I remember the efforts that were needed the first 4 seasons to ride medium to large distances, the slowness and the difficulties of every movement. Now that's no longer an issue and main characters are readily teleported anywhere.This show has become a huge budget mess.p.s., some side notes. Daario in Meereen has been completely forgotten since end of season 6. And what about Ghost? why didn't Jon take Ghost with him at the parley with Dany (and her dragons)? Maybe Ghost is seasick? And what has become of Dorne? The entire Dornish army and Dorne itself seem to have disappeared from earth since Ellaria and sandsnakes were eliminated. And what about Heartsbane, the big Valyrian sword of house Tarly? Lord Tarly still hasn't noticed its disappearance, or he didn't have any suspicion that its disappearance may be linked to Sam's escape, or simply he doesn't care about (although he looked rather fond of it). Since he also knew where Sam was directed, rescuing the sword should be no more than some hours' job to a couple of his men."
546," And Jaime is gone again!
",3,False,"This episode had some really great moments. I enjoyed watching it, even though it had little action. However, I grow more and more frustrated with this season: I have been waiting for some interesting twists and now there are only two episodes left and it seems that we only get plot point that we've been anticipating. I feel like I had been given a programme of the show beforehand, and now I just follow it, expecting every step of the show. All the twists that I didn't see coming were impossible to predict, because they just simply make no sense from the logical point of view. And this refers strongly to this episode. -Jaime's storyline I don't understand Jaime's motives in this episode. His actions are totally out of characters. I guess I should have gotten used to it, but still Jaime should want nothing to do with both Cersei and Daenerys. He has seen how dangerous both of them are. But instead of leaving Cersei and hiring a Faceless man to kill Dany, he tries to make peace, that'll benefit both of them. Cersei not killing Tyrion is completely out of character for her, as well. She has all the reasons to kill him, even Dany would understand it if she did it. She could still try to negotiate with Dany afterwards.+Tyrion's storyline Tyrion's storyline is one of the strongest this episode. His guilt and failed attempts at making Dany less cruel, walking through the ashes, his discussion with Varys, his conversation with Jaime – it was all very compelling and Dinklage's acting was great. I hope they will continue this theme with Tyrion's guilt, maybe it will make this character interesting again. +/-Jon's storyline Jon's scene with the dragon was probably the least subtle hinting ever, but it was very beautiful and well-made. I don't really know what to think about this character's development, though. He has some very good lines, specifically when he tells Dany that he's a king too and doesn't have to listen to her or when he says to his ""fellowship"" that they're all on the same side, because they're all still breathing. However, he does some things that are out of character. I always thought Jon was rather intelligent and had strong morals. Here, he shows Dany that he's not happy with what she's done and then just shrugs it off. Dany makes no argument to convince him that what she did was right. She does say that she does everything for ""the good of the people"", but she never mentions why people would have a better life with her as a ruler or how she is going to make it better. So far, she made nothing better for anyone, she only murdered people. Also, I don't know why Jon boasts about making the stupidest decision this season (coming to Dragonstone) to convince Dany to let him make an even more stupid decision (go beyond the Wall).-Winterfell I suppose that this tension between Arya and Sansa has some point. Sansa has reasons to feel betrayed and usurped by Jon and Arya has reasons to protect him. However, I'm still not convinced by this storyline. Moreover, the whole Grand Northern Scheme was just ridiculous. The scenes with Arya and Littlefinger following each other looked more like a cartoon than GoT. I would consider it a good comic relief, but I don't think the writers intended it as one. We'll see how his master plan ends, but for now it's rather pathetic. +Davos' storyline I liked that Davos was finally of some use and that we were reminded about his backstory as a smuggler. I absolutely loved seeing Gendry again. Also, I appreciate the rowing joke. It's a good thing that the creators are aware of fan memes and make use of them. -The logical and tactical catastrophe that is Tyrion's plan This is exactly what I mentioned above, this plan was so stupid and ridiculous that I could never have predicted it. Cersei lost practically on all fronts, her only success is that she still holds King's Landing. She has no army and almost no support amongst the lords of the Seven Kingdoms. She has nothing to contribute to the fight against the Others. Dany should storm King's Landing, defeat her in a matter of days and start uniting Westeros. This would be the wisest strategy in face of the impending threat of the White Walkers. Instead, they're going to waste 4-5 months to travel to the opposite part of the continent and go on an insanely dangerous trip, that realistically would end with all of them dead. And all of this only to get proof that may or may not convince Cersei to have an armistice. +The Fellowship of the Ring This is the strongest point of the episode. The show finally managed to show the importance of uniting in face of a common threat. This ""fellowship"" consists of characters with varying backstories, who don't have many reasons to love each other but they'll still have to stand together. I liked the dialogues between them and I wish they were given more screen time. +Jorah's return+Sam's storyline+burning of Randyll and Dickon – great reference to the Mad King, Tarly gained my respect for standing up to Dany-no Theon -no mention of UnsulliedTo sum up, this episode was a little messy and illogical when it comes to showing characters' motives and the absurdity of Tyrion's plan made it hard to watch. That said, it still had a few heart-warming moments that won me over."
547," Still great but lacking
",7,False,"A lower score for this episode in otherwise a great show altogether. Just one point - how come this great council on Dragonstone consisting of among st others such brains like Spider, Tyrion came to a conclusion that bringing one dead to King's Landing would have any impact on Queen Cersei which others just simply took for granted. Actually it's completely unbelievable. At least these two know her so well they shouldn't even be coming with such a notion. Against all evidence they send John Snow back beyond the Wall to prove something to somebody who simply doesn't care? Moreover, she can actually present them in response ""a dead man"" of her own by showing the creation of Qyburn (the Mountain). It's perfectly clear she will only try to play that to her advantage, which she admits already in this episode. This simply doesn't make sense to me. Her way of thinking is close to that of Littlefinger and both Spider and Tyrion are well aware of that. Yet, bringing a ""dead man"" to the South to show everybody else who matters (such as Oldtown Maesters / other Lords) the danger is real may unite the continent and could make sense after all."
548," The Magnificent Seven of the North
",10,True,"Wow. I'm really trying to appreciate the last episodes we have of this show because I don't believe there will ever be another show like it. For most of its run, Thrones has been a pleasantly slow-paced series. Part of its charm was seeing the show build out character arcs and plots so that when they finally paid off, it would have immense rewards. This season is an entirely different animal. Characters all of a sudden have teleportation abilities going from one side of the map to the other in merely an episode. Some people may be turned off by such a thing, I myself am just enjoying this ride. Things needed to happen faster this season and next, and the pace hasn't slowed down since the season 7 premiere. 'Eastwatch' was perhaps the least eventful episode in terms of action, but it nonetheless was full of goodies from beginning to end.There's so much to dig into, so I'll try to keep everything brief. Let's begin with Jon and Daenerys, because obviously. Let's just establish the fact that this show is ACTUALLY going there with them romantically. Don't tell me nobody else noticed how enamored Dany looked when Jon started talking about how he put his trust in her a few episodes back. I mean, wow, talk about a look. Putting aside the heritage issue, I'm all for this relationship. Which, brings me to Sam because him and Gilly literally came across the biggest bombshell of the show's history, and just swept it under the rug. I guess it's not technically official just yet, but Rhaegar and Lyanna apparently did have a secret marriage that only one maester knows about. So, in other words, Jon is a legitimate Targaryen!Speaking of bastards, Gendry finally made his return to the show tonight as he all of a sudden joined the main story thread. I would say it felt random and out of place, but his weapon is just too damn cool to say anything bad about him. This all lead to Jon, Gendry, Tormund, Jorah (yes, he returned too!), Beric, Thoros, and the flipping Hound heading to Eastwatch to try and capture a white walker to provide Cersei with proof of who the real enemy is. I'm sorry, but we just have to appreciate the Magnificent Seven of Game of Thrones taking on the army of the dead by themselves. We may not have gotten a battle this episode, but ending with them walking out into the abyss was good enough for me.I guess this brings me to Winterfell, where Bran had the vision of the army and Littlefinger plotted a little more. It seems fitting that Arya will eventually kill Littlefinger, but I'm enjoying just watching them two spy-each other-out for now. Having him set her up with the message Sansa wrote to Winterfell back in season 1 is frustrating (because who the heck would care about that at this point?) but it will provide enough weight for the tension between sisters to result in a bada** Littlefinger death scene, I just know it.There were a few Lannister reunions this week. Jaime returned to Cersei with bad news and Tyrion tried to convince Jaime to agree to talk to Cersei about a meeting between Dany and her. I almost highly doubt that meeting will ever get to face-face, wildfire is sure to play some sort of factor, but the direction they're going with this war is intriguing to say the least. To make things even more complicated, Cersei claims she is pregnant with her and Jaime's 4th child. I say claims because this could just be another ploy for her to gain Jaime's trust back, but it could also very well be real. If it is, doesn't it seem fitting that someone kills her through the gut just like the Lannister's did to Robb and Talisa back at the red wedding? Brutal, yes, but this show often provides great payback.Among other things, some great tidbits include: Jon petting Drogon! The combinations of Tyrion & Davos, and Jon & Gendry. Loved seeing a Stark and Baratheon reunion. And I'm glad Sam is finally leaving the Citadel, too bad he never found out about the fate of his father and brother. Overall, not as monumental as I thought it might be, but so dang effective. Game of Thrones has perhaps never been better than it is right now. Everything is hitting on all cylinders.+All these great dynamics+The Magnificent Seven of the North+More surprises+Jon and Dany potential romance+Gendry is back10/10"
549," Enjoy the ride
",6,False,"Here is how I feel and think about the show right now: I have no clue were Euron is (my thinking) and I don't care (feeling). And instead of rewatch the show or go on the internet to find out I simply don't care. Why? Because there is no coherent logic in Westoros' time and space. The characters are jumping around how the authors want them to.But let's talk about that Eastwatch episode. I want to point out some things I can't like and why I think this show lost it's mojo. We start with Jamie and Bronn. Oh boi, just a few scenes are the stakes were high and the audience thinks ""somebody will die, I don't see any escape for them"", well Jamie and Bronn were smarter than anybody. I though in the world of game of thrones you pay for your mistakes. Nope, just swim to the other side. Remember 2 headed shark attack when the depth of the lake was various depending on the camera angle? Well they want you to think that this is stupid, but GoT is serious about that. Then we see Tyrion in King's Landing, welcome home buddy, talking to Jamie. The authors could bring them together on the battlefield a few scenes ago but we would have missed some action with Bronn and Dragon. But it's okay, Tyrion need to be there. And how often we were told that Cersei hates Tyrion, even before he killed their father. So this Cersei knows that the used to be funny guy is in her home stadium and what is reaction? She will let him play there with her brother just to prove that Bronn is bad. Aha. Cersei could capture that dwarf and I mean he is the right hand of that dragon chick and it's not like Cersei has the upper hand in this battle of thrones right now.To that fella Sam. I though this could be an interesting story arc. I was wrong like in house of black and white or Bran Stark. I though those story arcs will add some new stuff to the world. Something special. Instead of more understanding of the GoT world we see some ignorant old guys. They are to lazy to follow some instructions in a book, they don't want to learn new stuff. Why are they so stupid? Why is anybody so freaking boring if he is not the good guy? Just to summarize: the whole last season Sam was walking to that library because nobody told him of that teleporters everybody else is using, he cured that friendzone guy, stole some books and scripts and that was the whole story arc so far. You can such a plot line but please put some mojo in between, show me something interesting not just cleaning of feces.A year ago I would have got angry because of this nonsense, not anymore. I realized GoT is for a broader audience and I was left out. Poor me, but who cares. HBO has it's cashcow. And there is a tradeoff less quality in the writing, more kaboom, more CGI and everybody can start watching the show from season 7. Really, you don't need anything from the past seasons. Remember the long journey of kalesei? It started well and then it was dragged off for too many seasons. You don 't need that anymore. Now she is on that rock and waiting for the suicide squad to return. What is she waiting for? To the suicide squad's plan: they want to catch someone of the dead army? So they have the time to travel south, catch one of them, travel back and Cersei will say ""yes, you are right, let's stop fighting each other until we kill that dead army"". And while our squad is traveling around that dead army will wait? Nobody thought about that they lure the whole army?A few days ago I watched Samurai Cop and I enjoyed it. Because of it's flaws it is entertaining. And I will watch more of that GoT stuff. Because it's surprising in a dumb way. What will they do next? Thanks to GoT I learned a lesson: something great can turn into something stupid. There is no constant in life, everything is in motion, go with the motion, enjoy the ride even if you got sick of it. Another lesson: sometimes the lake is deep and sometimes the lake is not deep, depending on your point of view. You see that deep meaning the authors of that TV show had in mind."
550," The aftermath of a battle and preparing for the war
",9,True,This episode opens almost immediately after the previous ended as we see that Jaime and Bronn had indeed survived the battle and escaped. There Lannister forces are captured and given a choice; bend the knee to Daenerys or die... a threat she follows through on. Once she returns to Dragonstone listens to a plan that might enable a truce; at least until the Wight's are defeated... if they can be defeated. This entails Tyrion having a secret meeting with his brother while Davos Seaworth goes to see an almost forgotten character and bring him back into the action. Back in Winterfell Arya believes Sansa isn't running things as well as she might and suspects Littlefinger of treachery.Not surprisingly this episode isn't quite as impressive as the previous one; it is all about the character development as people come to terms with what happened. People had heard of Daenerys's dragons; now they have to deal with their reality as well as the fighting prowess of the Dothraki. The events in Winterfell were intriguing as loyalties are questions; particularly that of Littlefinger; a character who has always been delightfully devious. While there may be a lot less action that doesn't mean there is none; two men die in the fire of Daenerys's dragon and two more get their heads caved in when they get a little too nosey. There are some faults; over the last few episodes we have seen characters travelling very long distances within the course of the episode; here it happens even more so with no obvious indication that time has passed. Overall I still really enjoyed the episode and look forward to seeing what will happen now key characters are north of the wall again.
551," Impressive but rushed and illogical
",4,False,"If this was the only episode of GoT I had ever seen, I would never, ever consider watching it again. Yes, the effects were amazing and this is the first time I see a dragon made in such a detail, it was breathtaking. This was very well done. BUT ... the story line is weak. The characters have no depth, you get no sense of time and space, their decisions make them mere caricatures. Very poor writing for a show that started as an amazing TV series. (and I don't even read the books!). It's really a shame."
552," Not a logical story
",5,False,"So far I found game of thrones character decisions quite logical. But this time I really don't like the decision of Daenerys and the preposition of Tyrion to go north of the wall to catch a white walker. This act is completely forced to make the story continue and to bring few new twists. It is completely illogical and here is why;First of all, Deanerys has army strong enough to capture the Kings landing and then continue north. It would take less time to do this, then to travel north and then back south towards King's landing. Not to mention that since the season 2 the characters move with a speed as they would be travelling by a plane.Secondly, they decide to risk their lives just to show Cersei a zombie. A woman who is their worst enemy, has absolutely no morale and is not trustworthy at all. Lets put all those ""people need to unite to fight zombies together"" aside and face that this is a completely different story to a Game of thrones that we are used to. It smells like some kind of a Disney movie.And thirdly, doesn't a zombie arise from every dead person in the north at the time of the winter? Isn't this a reason they are burning corps there? So even if they decide to show Cersei a zombie, wouldn't it be easier to execute a prisoner or something?So far I've really loved the series. Please don't ruin it with the episodes like this."
553," nothing special
",7,False,"all i see in this site its a lot of fanboy rating 10 even when we are not even close to 10... GoT is by far my fav series but this episode was nothing more than a 6 max 7 out of 10... 1st scene they teleported on the other side with an armor and without an hand... jamies friend maybe can kill a dragon with his force if he can swim with armored jamie coast to coast all the travels in this episode have been with teleport like jamie back to cercei... there are good stuff like reunions, but also final scene is disappointing... arya with her super training getting tricked... I repeat, stop being fanboys, if this season was 12 episodes i would have said OK its an 8/10 but we have 2 more episodes and u give me this. 7/10 is the right vote and im kind"
554," An Effort at Peace
",8,True,"Tyrion has seen so much of evil. He was detested by his own family at his birth. When one looks at the simple disrespect for life, it's interesting he wasn't stabbed in his crib. This has led to him being a truly moral character, having had to overcome so much, including the betrayal by his own sister. Tyrion believes in some sort of peaceful settlement. The big war is coming and Cersei hasn't got all that much of an army and must depend on alliances (she has lots of gold). It is decided by Dany and Jon Snow that capturing one of the wights and bringing him to Cersei would seal the deal. Why is this so? So off go our heroes to capture one of these guys, amidst the hordes of the undead (they seem to come back even when you break them into pieces). I fail to see any of the logic in this, other than to set up a battle with these guys. We also have Sansa and Arya at odds. Arya thinks Sansa has taken the easy road, playing up to whomever she can manipulate. Arya, of course, has become the consummate warrior. This is Ana intriguing episode, but it doesn't lack a good deal of common sense and some sort of precious moments."
555," What happened to the twists and turns?
",5,False,"The fan theories floating around are more developed when they are leaked and I think the director/writer should respect the audience's IQ. Alan Taylor who directed some episodes of Season 1 and 2 should be bought back in the helm. His direction was fantastic and I still remember him, can't say if the North remembers him or not!After Joffrey's fate, the series is going in a downhill. The library reading session was quite lame and boring. Every character is travelling like they are using a helicopter. Come on writers, everything seems a bit rushed and forced!With the concentration on narrative, we're left with an outing that can't help but feel like it's lacking where it really counts. In short, old wine in a new bottle!"
556," setting up the end game in a rushed manner
",8,True,"I get it, audience wants to see wars and the fight for Westeros and the fight for the wall. But cramming up so much 'story' in one episode with Ser Davos going from DragonStone to King's Landing and back, and then onwards to Eastwatch is a bit comical. Did Westeros invent chartered air travel betweens seasons 6 and 7? Tyrion throwing caution to the wind in going to King's Landing, Dany burning the Tarly father-son right after proclaiming she is unlike Cersei, Jon allowing Gendry to join in like 2 minutes - such decisions are unlike the characters themselves and do not go well with their overall character arc.HBO is paying more emphasis to visual imagery and CGI ( Drogon - Jon scene was amazing! ) and less on nuanced story telling at this point. In some sense, I am also happy that things are moving at a brisk pace and the war with the Night King is finally upon us. Maybe this is necessary evil, but the book reader in me feels injustice done towards the painstakingly detailed world of George R.R. Martin!"
557," This game has shifted from chess to tic-tac-toe...
",1,False,"It feels the amazing world built in the first 5 seasons has been handed over to a couple of teenage fans to shuffle around...We have had 2 decent episodes out of 5 so far, with 2 to go. This math simply does not add up...I used to be so excited and proud to recommend this series to anyone and everyone with a brain. Now I feel embarrassed to admit I still watch it myself. This has gone from an intricate and highly intelligent story into the most mundane and predictable nonsense. The fan theories floating around are more developed and thought out than the actual direction the plot of the show is taking...The p*ss poor writing, directing and editing of the last 2 seasons have affected the cast of great actors as well into performing forced dialogues and scenarios. The show has lost it's heart. Everything feels so flat, there are no more logical twists or schemes. Characters just show up from place A to place B and read their lines in the most monotone way possible then proceed to move from point B back to point A to repeat their forced dialogues. Motives make no sense anymore and every scenario is so predictable that fans essentially guess major plot points weeks ahead, and in very unfamiliar GoT fashion, the show runners seem to oblige the silliest of the theories. This episode felt like a combination of ""Star Trek: Next Generation"" cross ""Lost"".The problem lies in the fact that this series started out attracting intelligent viewers globally due to its complexity and multi-layered story line that resonated in reality and felt extremely grounded. It has now turned (Seasons 6 & 7) into your average run of the mill TV series riddled in plot armour and predictability and therefor appeals to teenagers and children and has essentially sold out it's core fan base. This in turn has us stuck in a predicament where we are too invested to turn our backs on the series, therefore we end up lying to ourselves that this series is still what it once was... It's not. It hurts me to say it as I've tried to lie to myself and get myself to take Seasons 6 and 7 seriously and ignore the shortcomings, but my brain simply will not allow it. Therefore I feel somewhat betrayed and my intelligence insulted week after week and this show has me feeling stupid for still watching it.Peter Baelish (the man who started the war of the 5 kings), has turned into a cartoon villain from Darkwing Duck, which therefore trickles down to every other major character being completely dumb-ed down as well. I will be watching the series until the end as I have committed 7 + years of my life to this world now, but I don't think I will continue to lie to myself to save my feelings any longer.... Season 6 had 2 great episodes, and season 7 has had 2 as well. That is 4 episodes out of the last 15 that have been GoT standards. Whereas Seasons 1 through 5 were near flawless in my book. The series died with Jon Snow as far as I'm concerned and I will gladly re-watch the first 5 seasons over and over again, and fill in the rest for myself I suppose...So f#*%@$g disappointing."
558," Things are set in motion
",10,True,"Season 7 has to be one of the best seasons so far of Game of Thrones, despite moving remarkably fast. Eastwatch allows us to breathe after the epic episode last week, and does so in a very character driven way.We open with a brilliant scene between Bronn and Jamie, then are taken to another visually breathtaking scene of Tyrion walking through the ashes of burnt Lannister bodies. Peter Dinklage is truly a master actor, he didn't even have to say a word in this short scene, because his face says it all. He's torn, you know he wants to stand by Dany, but also doesn't want to see his family ruined. The meeting between Jamie and Tyrion was very brief, I would loved to have seen a little more of that, hell even a good scene between Tyrion and Bronn. I sorely missed their on screen duo. The scenes in the North were great also, I loved that not everyone is getting along, as it should be. Arya is calling Sansa on her bulls***, and conducting her own little investigation on Littlefinger. I also loved seeing Baelish doing his sneaking things again.Sam's scenes were more or less the same, but this time he's gotten sick of being told what to do and takes a stand, which I really liked, it shows how much his character has come from the punching bag from season 1. And am I the only one that caught that sneaky line with Gilly reading the marriage certificate? We know what your doing D&D you smart bastards.We get a brilliant meeting between all our favourite characters towards the end of this episode, and I can't wait to see them in action. You know that some of them are going to die, and please I hope the Hound, Jon and Jorah survive. I won't be Game of Thrones without them.Eastwatch is a very character episode, with great production designs, as always, great acting, and a fantastic build-up, to a next episode that is most likely going to be freaking mind-blowing.I can see some people having an issue with this episode, and that would be all the time jumps. Throughout this whole series, things have moved reasonably slow. Characters would take seasons to get from one place to the other, but in this episode, they transport here and there within just a view scenes. But all this is understandable. Things are ending now, the Game is nearly over, and things are moving fast. 9.6/10"
559," Weakest writing in the entire series this episode
",3,False,"It's starting to become more noticeable how important George RR Martin's narrative is to the success of the show. This episode is the least believable yet and it's very obvious certain things happen just for the sake of more drama but are too ridiculous to believe. First, Jaime and Bronne escape from being captured by Dany, Bronne somehow able to carry a fully armored Jaime from the bottom of a lake 300 years to the other side. Lord Tarly deciding not to join Dany yet in the last time we saw him he was being strong-armed to join the Lannisters against his oath. Then calling Dany a foreigner and not born in Westeros even though she was born on Dragonstone. Drama for the sake of drama. The dialog of each reunion fell flat. The set up for the Arya-Sansa confrontation to come was also pretty weak. We will see how that plays out, I don't see how that can be used against Sansa as there is no reason Arya's disklike of Sansa can be strong enough after 6 years apart to not see the obvious that the note was forcefully written and meaningless."
560," Build up for the biggest battle in GOT history
",8,True,"GOT returned to us with the aftermath of field of fire 2.0.A good episode but I was expecting more from the reunions between Tyrion and Bronn and also Jorah and Dany.Just felt the episode was a little rushed and the writing let the episode down a bit but nevertheless a good episode and pumped up for the biggest battle in GOT history!Also the citadel story seems to be over now,so really gonna miss Jim broadbent as archmaester,he did a fantastic job!"
561," Forced story and lazy writing
",6,False,"I used to praise GOT but it is clear that Season 7 is by far the worst Season yet. Especially last nights episode. I was always fond of callbacks but now I feel that this is just an excuse for bad writing, as the dialogs lack GRRM charm and many things just don't make sense. There was no flow from the one scene to the other..everything were cut abruptly and felt forced. The Jon-Daenerys moments=forced. The Drogon- Jon moment forced, Gendry's return forced,the only genuinely believable to some point moments were the moments between Tyrion and Jamie and between Jorah and Daenerys,other than that all the rest were clumsy and seemed fake and without reasoning."
562," Buildup before they Blast!
",9,True,"East Watch was all about building up of many many plots, all of which were superbly done with amazing story telling.Many reunions took place, well I won't mention which ones to avoid spoilers but all of them were so superb that I can't wait to see how they all turn up.Little Finger is doing what he is best at, but this time I just wish that Starks change their legacy.Danaerys showing both sides of her again in this episode, soft and hard, which shows that she can be a different ruler than what westeros has seen in the past. The scenes between Danaerys and Jon are somehow getting soft and romantic.A glimpse of Old cunning Cersie was back which was good to watch as her scenes weren't as strong in the previous episodes as they used to be.You might not like this episode if you always want an action packed episode like the Spoils of War, but let me assure you guys the plots built up in this episode are exactly like the silence before the storm and something special, very special is coming in next week's episode. Can't wait for that.9/10"
563," Season 7 goes south
",5,False,"Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.After such a magnificent previous episode in ""The Spoils of War"", it is understandable that fans would want the next episode to be good or as worthy, even if it wasn't as good or a masterpiece (both of which a tall order seeing as such high quality is difficult to equal or surpass). Unfortunately, ""Eastwatch"" turned out to be a major disappointment. Not just the worst episode of the seventh season, but also for me the worst episode since Season 6's ""No One"" and one of my least favourite 'Game of Thrones' episodes. It's not terrible, it's actually watchable but for a show as great as 'Game of Thrones' watchable is not good enough.""Eastwatch"" certainly has good things. Visually, it looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well, while the special effects are among the best of the latter season episodes.One cannot not mention the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film. The acting is, considering the material, quite good, though no tour-De-force performances. Lena Headey and Peter Dinklage come off best, concerning Dinklage though it is very difficult to get a bad performance from him. A reasonable job is done setting things up and putting things into place. There are minor revelations, such as Gendry's return, and some nice reunions. As well as some good attention to character interaction, such as Arya and Sansa, with Cersei being the most interesting character here.However, there are disappointing elements which generally have been covered already. There are no real surprises or shocks, the biggest revelations are not huge and not leaving-one-floored-like. Other episodes do a much better job advancing characters and progressing the story in general. There are moments here but not enough. It all feels rather bland, lacking the fire-blazing intensity of ""The Spoils of War"". ""Eastwatch"" is far too rushed, making events feel choppy and jumpy. Too much of the story is not developed e nough and borders on the implausible. Tyrion's plan agreed especially, easily the most absurd and lacking-in-consistency-and-logic story he's had and such an interesting character is much better than this. For a show whose scripts are generally thought-provoking, layered, passionate and sensitive, the writing here majorly disappoints and actually the complete opposite. Here the writing is forced, repetitive, bland, simplistic and far from subtle. The character writing has been far meatier, nuanced and complex.Overall, watchable but hugely disappointing. 5/10 Bethany Cox"
564," Sophie's Choice
",7,False,"I actually liked this episode, probably for a bit different reasons than many. Of course, nothing makes much sense anymore, but that's been going on for a while now.After being thrown into an abyss three centimetres away from where his horse was galloping, Jaime is drawn out of the river by Bronn. The battle is over, and they are really far away from it, leading to all sorts of hilarious conclusions about their ability to travel underwater while in full armor. Just the sort of terrible writing you've come to expect in the show's latest seasons. But then comes the good part, as Hitlaerys Targaryen gathers up the remaining Lannisters and gives them Sophie's choice: Submit to her, Hitler, first of her name, Fuhrer of the Andals, the Rhoynar and the First Men and bend the knee, of be burned alive. Randyll Tarly and his son, whose knees do not bend easily, become the first martyrs in Daenerys' reign of terror. Now now, wait a minute. I think I got carried away a little: Tyrion and Varys are seen worried about the Mad Queen, but we all know D&D do not have the mental capacity to actually make this happen - it's just some temporary sub-plot to later ""relieve"" the audience by reassuring them Daenerys is actually good. Nonetheless: offering a glimpse of Daenerys' true repulsing self is very satisfying, even if her illiterate fans who are actually thrilled at the hint of a romance with Jon (for pity's sake) will still justify it.At Winterfell, Arya offers some terrible advice to the usual bad- advice giver, Sansa, and is then easily tricked by Petyr into discovering something meant to cause strife between the sisters. At least Littlefinger did something remotely devious for the first time in many a season.Back in Oldtown, the ancient cliché of ""grey old wise men are wrong and young enthusiastic Sam is right"" continues, as Sam simply ditches them, which is a bit silly, as the entire plot in Oldtown appeared useful in discovering something Stannis had already told him and that idiotic cure of greyscale - they sent him there, but ignoring the whole magic subplot of the books, he had little business to do. Anyway, Sam is a likable character, so not a total waste.On Dragonstone, they decide to send Tyrion to negotiate with Jaime a meeting so that Jon can bring a zombie and convince the Lannisters of the threat in the North. Join is joined in this quest by Mormont, who apparently simply took the first ship to Dragonstone. Naturally, Tyrion, smuggled by Davos, is in sunny King's Landing within the hour, as such a meeting is really easy to arrange. Meeting is over before you know it, Davos retrieves Gendry and they are on their way. Meanwhile Cersei seems to imply that meeting with the enemy is a good chance to dispose of the enemy, but I can already see a Jaime disagreement when he sees evidence of white walkers. The Gendry retrieval is just another case of fan service (complete with meme reference...), which has been the doom of the show and half the reason for its downward spiral in plot quality - however, I will admit I liked how he is modelled after Robert Baratheon, that was a good touch.Jon and his companions leave Dragonstone and are back at Eastwatch- by-the-sea instantaneously, taking the superluminal travels of the show to a whole new level. Indeed, it is buffling that they still send ravens, when everyone can simply walk a letter across at least one continent in half a day. There they find the Hound, Beric and Thoros who strolled across all of Westeros and were captured just around the corner. They pick them up to go to this rather ill-advised quest, which will probably already be over in the next episode, and they may still have time to go to King's Landing for coffee."
565," Nothing but PURE GOLD !!!!
",10,True,"WOOOOOOW.. From where can i start? HOLLY S*** !! Eastwatch is by far the best episode in season 7, a MASTERPIECE, it even surpasses The Spoils Of War, i did not see that coming to be honest. The episode contained huge revelations, many reunions and amazing set of events, it was beautifully written by d§d , no we can admit that they finally found a way to tell the story in such a magnificent way. Eastwatch has set up everything perfectly for the next main episode. Brace yourselves folks, because episode 6 is going to be much bigger. Can't wait.9.7/10"
566," ""Bad things are coming""
",8,True,"*** This review may contain spoilers *** Since the beginning of the season I was waiting for the story to get back on track but it seems there's no way this will happen. I mean, while the dead walkers are not even half way to Eastwatch (which should be about 2 days walking), Jon has time for a long vacation to Dragonstone which would be trip 5 times longer and even comes back to Eastwatch (a distance 6 times longer than the one the zombies are struggling to cover). In addition sir Davos (who joins Jon) has time to go to Kings Landing and back. I think they've inventing the teleport in between seasons. The same thing with Dany traveling to the fight and back - OK she had Drogon but how the heck the Dothraki and Thyrion kept the pace?! Now back to this episode: -Why do they need to convince Cercei?! She has no army!! (she may have money, but it makes no sense to gather the mercenaries as she will need to pay them without fighting - supposing that all the others are in the north fighting). -and in Winterfell, what happened to Arya's training, did she forgot everything. She fought blind with the Waif but is not able to figure it out that Littlefinger is playing her?! The only story that makes sense in this season is the one of Samwell Tarly. I get the feeling that this is turning into a rushed ending as in the last 10 episode of a soap opera."
567," Excellent plot progression that sets up for an incredible final 2 episodes.
",10,True,"*Warning, spoilers ahead for those who have not seen this episode*Wow, from Robert's bastard resembling his father with the famous war-hammer, to Littlefingers exceptional thought process and genius but very concerning plans, this episode had me hooked from start to finish. Everything in this episode really shows how great of a show Game of Thrones is, and with all of us eagerly awaiting the great battle to come, this episode sets up next week for what should be the most thrilling 70+ minutes of the series thus far. Daenerys seemed to show signs of her father's impulsive ways, by contradicting and justifying her actions. Jorah's return to Daenerys saw him be as loyal as ever , and the the re-union of Tyrion and his brother was a scene that showed how great the two actors are. I was stunned by Littlefinger's art of deception, constantly being 3 steps ahead of everybody else effortlessly. The meeting with Jon and Gendry was filled with irony. Two people trying to relate through their father's names when Gendry's father murdered Jon's. It was an excellent scene that reinforces how game-changing Jon's birthright could prove to be, especially with the impatience growing in the North. Each scene of this episode left me feeling more satisfied than the prior, no scene felt like a filler, the time jumps and pacing did leave me worried at the beginning of the season but the episodes are managing to keep a level of consistency that both season 4 and season 6 achieved. Loving the season so far, this one gets a 9.5/10 from me!"

Tyrion convinces Jon and Daenerys that a Wight needs to be retrieved, to prove that the Army of the Dead exists and he meets with Jaime to discuss it.

Uncle Ben saves Jon jajajajajajaj he was watching the fight from far 🤔 10. Everyone saw Jon fall into the lake surrounded by thousands of WW but they have the hope that he was going to rise from that lake kill all the WW while he was freezing, find a horse and ride to the wall 🤔 11. This was the worst for me, now the WW are divers and the night king is a magician that appears enormous chains so they can pull out the dragon form the lake 🤔This episode get me depressed for weeks, this is not GOT"
570," Not the same Game of Thrones
",5,False,"I understand when they bring Jon back to life. It happend to Baric before and Jon is ESSENTIAL to the plot as (probably) azor ahai. This episode was a new low though, first off Tormund should have been dead. He got overrun by wights and got somehow saved by the hound? He's not absolutely essential so kill him off why not, sad moment and he's gone. It's just boring half the time now without any characters at risk of dying even if they make crucial mistakes or missteps. Ned, Robb, Catelyn, Margery all had made mistakes and they paid for it. Jon in this episode? Stays behind pointlessly fighting endless wights until Danaerys MUST leave him behind. Should be dead, or at least benjen could have came out of nowhere 1 minute earlier and gave him the horse/pulled him out of the water. Instead he shakes off what 4 wights, climbs out of the water after 2 minutes all alone and than the walkers come back? Okay cool action episode but it was predictable and not to mention that whole side quest Jon and the boys went on was rediculous in the first place"
571," MAJOR SPOILERS The Only Truly Bad Episode of Game of Thrones
",1,False,"Game of Thrones is my favorite tv show of all time. While there other shows that might have stayed more consistent in their later seasons, no other show has such a memorable group of characters, no other show has such an interesting world, no other show is as emotional, epic, or realistically tragic. Something great about the show is how characters don't escape from death just because they seem important. Another good thing about the show is that even when one storyline in an episode is weak there are normally other storylines that are done very well. In this episode however, none of this applies. Both storylines are horrible. The timeline is all messed up, the fact that almost everyone survived is ridiculous, the arya and sansa plotline still makes no sense even after watching the next episode. Benjen stark shows up just to die. This episode nearly ruined Arya who is one of the best characters. Gendry shouldn't have been able to run back that quickly, Daenerys shouldn't have been able to make it north that quickly. I could go on but the point is this: Game of Thrones was great because of its politics, morally gray characters, realistic stakes even with its fantasy setting, epic action, and its willingness to kill off any character while still being satisfying. This episode has none of that. There is some decent acting and a few good moments that are only spectacle. Fortunately the finale was good. Hopefully season 8 will be back to the quality of seasons 5 and 6 (the show will never be as good as seasons 1,3, and 4 again which are the best seasons). Benioff and Weiss, please don't ever write anything this stupid again"
572," Supersonic raven
",7,False,"Work this out. Our heroes are surrounded by the walking dead. Gendry runs to the wall, tells his story to the night's watch, a message is composed and sent by a raven over a thousand miles to Dragonstone, Daenerys Targaryen gets organized and flys back ... all in 1 night. That has to be the fastest raven ever."
573," Some epic scenes, but terrible writing
",4,False,"***** Might contain slight spoilers ***** For me, this episode is one of the weakest in the entire series, with plenty of things wrong with it, but let's start with the good staff first.The visual and sound effects are good, directing is fine, acting is as good as it was in the first seasons. Some scenes are epic, especially the end of the episode.But everything else is straight awful. The dialog in the first seasons was much superior to what we see now. The drama between the characters, their motivations, cunning tricks and lies are either absent or terribly made. And the general plot writing is just horrible, not at all GOT level, more like Marvel movies with last minute saves and illogical events. The lack of the books shows vastly and the show writers are not able to write anything nearly as good as George R. R. Martin creates.Generally, the show has gone downhill after season four, with only a few good episodes in season six, and one in each of seasons five and seven."
574," The show now lacks almost everything that made it great
",7,False,"It is hard to come to terms with the fact that this show sucks now. Up to Season 5, it was one of the best I have seen on TV and I absolutely loved it, 10/10. Unfortunately, the show took a big dive from season 6 and it has reached a new low with this latest episode.Clearly, D&D, the two show-runners and writers, have depended on GRRM's storytelling and it is now obvious that they are not up to the task of continuing the story on their own. For a long time I thought that D&D were swimming along just fine, but when the tide receded, it was revealed that they were swimming without a swimming suit all the time...The show now lacks almost everything that made it great in seasons 1-5, notably:1. Its darkness and unpredictability. It hit you in the stomach when you didn't expect it. It dared to take your favourite characters away from you. It shocked you with violence in both a physical and psychological sense. Situations very often ended in the worst possible way. But from season 6 the show feels very different. It has become tame and predictable, even a little boring. Bringing back Jon Snow was a bad idea as it is not true to spirit of the earlier episodes and unfortunately it got worse after that. Did anyone think Jaime was really dead after the loot train attack in season 7? Hell no. We know nothing is going to happen to him, and that's why this show is lame now.2. What I liked most about the show was that it was well written. The story made sense, the characters were believable, there was logic and motivation behind people's actions. Compare this to the most recent episodes of season 7 and the difference couldn't be any bigger. Here people make incomprehensible decisions and their actions lack motivation. How come Dany doesn't believe Jon Snow about the White walkers when he tells her about it personally, but immediately believes everything when a raven arrives? If it was so fast and easy to travel North on the dragon, why didn't she do it before to see the army of the dead herself, rather than letting Jon Snow go on a suicide mission? Where in the world did the white walkers get those huge chains from to drag the dead dragon out of the ice lake? The plot silliness in this episode is endless.3. The show used to be more of a drama/play than an action movie. In earlier seasons, we often didn't directly witness big battles, rather we heard the character's exchanges before and after a battle happened. Believe it or not, but there are people like me who appreciate the dialogue, the drama, the emotional interactions of characters more than sword battles and CGI-dragons. Unfortunately, the show-runners have turned it into a blockbuster action movie now. With GoT, it was the first time in many years that I felt a movie or series had intelligent, well written dialogue. But apparently it was all GRRM, not D&D. Tyrion's dialogue for example feels completely out of character since season 6.4. All the characters that were cool in the earlier seasons just plain suck now. Jon Snow is a big wuss and makes the worst decisions ever after his resurrection. Attacking Winterfell when he is outnumbered? Sure. Personally leading a suicide mission North of the wall? Of course. Stupidly running away from his escape dragon? You bet. etc.. Arya does pretty much nothing except lurk around Winterfell. Wasn't there something with a list of people she meant to kill? Well, apparently she forgot about that and prefers to needlessly creep out her sister. Cersei just makes a stone face and otherwise does very little. Tyrion used to be one of the most clever characters in the story, who regularly outwitted others, but now doesn't do anything either except give bad advice to Dany. The conflict between Arya and Sansa seems forced and it is not convincing.The reason I'm still watching is mainly to see how it will all end, as the end will assumedly follow GRRMs plot outline and will therefore be semi-official."

I could imagine it would have been way safer for John if both have taken the horse but there was ""no time""...."
576," No longer afraid for the main characters...
",7,False,"Back then I used to watch GoT in total silence without anyone's company because I wanted to enjoy every single detail that show was offering me. As soon as I started to make popcorn and food I realized that the show has changed. I understand that the big war has finally come to our doors and the show is coming to an end, and that there is no much space left for scheming, plotting and politics, but only for reunions and action scenes. Despite that, the things could've gone in another direction.The show has lost its consistency throughout seasons, now we have mostly bad written episodes with few gems here and there. The last season was mostly bad and slow except episodes 5, 9 and 10 that blew my mind and made me forget lazy writing. But let's talk about things that bother me regarding the last episode.I know that the episode was bad when I have a feeling that I' m not watching GoT but some other random show on TV. I am no longer afraid for main characters, they have plot armor now, therefore there is no tension anymore while watching the show. You just know that they are going to survive. If this were GoT style from 1-5 season, there would be dead people all over. The magnificent 7 or as people call them Suicide squad couldn't survive fighting the bunch of deads/wights and freezing cold beyond the Wall. The mission was stupid as hell at first place. Please do not make us wonder if Jon Snow is going to die by throwing him in the lake because we all know that's not going to happen, at least not twice. I was not concerned for him, he has great fighting and survival abilities, and now also a resistance to hypothermia.The episode was very predictable, even though I didn't watch the preview for it, I already knew what was going to happen, my boyfriend also who, I must mention, watches it occasionally, he's been following GoT with me from season 6. Only red shirts died and Thoros for whom I don't really care.I don't want to elaborate problems such as big chains out of nowhere, incomprehensible timeline, spears flying so high aimed to a moving target because I feel many people have done that already.Arya and Sansa scenes were OK for me, Arya though acting a little bit out of her character. I thought she was smarter and that she learned how to determine the truth from lie. Tyrion, one of the smartest people in Westeros, suddenly became dumb with his illogical plans and naive counsels.I only want to mention one more thing and that is Jon and Dany romance. Some people like it and they are rooting for them to be together, but I just don't see it. I don' t see chemistry between them, it's a little bit rushed and forced, or maybe it's because I was very keen to Ygritte. The scene where Jon calls Daenerys Dany was cringing to the extent that I closed my eyes and couldn't even look at them, it was so embarrassing. I just don' t see them get together at the end, maybe the incest is something acceptable for her as she being a Targaryen, but it's not something Jon would do.I am still very big fan of GoT and I will continue watching the show which was amazing and now it' s good. It is still one of the best shows out there, very entertaining with great scenery, SGI, costumes and still good dialogues."
577," Where the show lost credibility.
",5,False,"I am STUNNED this episode is rated 9.2 at the time of this review. It just goes to show the flaws of a starred rating system, as most blind fans will just rate an episode 10/10 if they enjoyed it. This episode is better than any episode from season 1-4? Give me a break.Plot armour is rampant here, something that does not belong in the GoT world, and has been shown to us over and over again in previous seasons that no character is safe.. But Jon is!Without even getting into the ridiculous, contrived plan devised by Tyrion to capture a wight, no main characters die. The red priest dies, but he's not a major character. The worst thing about his death was that he died to a zombie polar bear. A complete waste of time, as it only kills a bunch of expendables and injures Thoros.This is where D&D decided to push the visual spectacle of the show, rather than the classic, logical, carefully thought plotlines of GoT that we all came to love. Unfortunate at the time of writing this (waiting on S8E5), GoT doesn't get much better, and it's painfully clear that the quality of writing drops to all time lows, starting with this episode.It looks nice though, always nice to see dragons doing their thing. It's just a shame that they were only there so the Night King can get his hands on a dragon to break through the wall, as it's clear that D&D had no clue how the army of the dead were meant to pass the wall."
578," Cliché
",5,False,Everything is becoming predictable and unprofessional.
579," Disappointing: Game of Shame
",1,False,"This is becoming painful. Let's try to explain something... In fiction and fantasy, you can suspend the rules of logic, as long as you establish a reality based on fantastic assumptions. This is called ""suspension of disbelief"". So far so good. As an example, if we see ""Superman"", we all accept that he can fly, because he is from Krypton (of course). But precisely, that is the basis of a good fantasy, even if it separates from reality, it has its own rules defined. If the story has a good quality, it will follow that rules, without making exceptions. In the case of this series, specially during the last season (although there are previous examples) they are breaking the rules that George R.R. Martin established for good. Time is not flexible. Westeros has long distances. And news take time to arrive. Whatever crows, dragons, green-seers or visions in the fire you want to put, you can not skip this logic. Trips take time. News doesn't arrive in seconds. The speed of hyperspace that is reaching the series, is characteristic of Star Wars (another fantastic universe, with its own rules), not Song of Ice and Fire. It's just an example, I will not refer to Deus Ex Machinas (hideous) or even stupid decisions taken by characters that seemed coherent (the Suicide Squad's weekend trip beyond the wall or even Jamie traveling to Dorne, unfortunate). At a minimum, the rules of the fictional universe in which the story is told must be respected. If you skip that, you lose the taste in history, because the illusion of fiction fails. Without that illusion, history becomes a stupid nonsense."
580," Some blokes are going for a stroll beyond the wall
",3,False,But forget to bring their horses. You've got to be kidding me.
581," HBO's Walk Of Shame
",3,False,"There are 3 things I want to bring up before I criticize this show:1. There are die-hard fantasy fans that watch Game of Thrones, and then there are a good number of intellectually inclined viewers that consciously stay away from ""dragon & knight"" stories but followed this series early on, because it was epic in its attention to detail, raw in its medieval texture, intelligent in its plot, politics and character motivations, relatable to life with its questioning of moral and existential issues, and lastly not barren of depth like generic fantasy usually is. 2. There was also the depth in characterization that made us care about each character's perspective and struggle, which was because the original chapters in the book were written in First-Person Narrative, each named after a character. The benefit of First-Person Narrative was that the reader became familiar with the unique thoughts, desires, moral codes, and existential angst of each main character which kept the cast variegated and rich. This translated well on screen because they had material to work with. 3. Myth-making is an art. World-building is an art. And Epics necessarily imply sense of journey. When you artfully create myths like money and religion, people place their faith in them because the myths become true for themselves. Similarly, when you build a fictitious world meticulously, you find people discussing little details such as ""the quality of wine in Dorne compared to Highgarden with passion - that's when you know people care about your creation, because of its details, and certain spatial and temporal laws you will not fool around with, which the characters must respect. That includes travel times.All above was spectacularly executed and devotedly followed by fanboys and critical audience alike in the first 4 seasons. All good so far.NOW THEN, As seasons passed, HBO began catering to the increasing fanbase of adolescents, sandpapering its raw edges to make it more palatable to conservative audiences worldwide. While Season 5 and 6 were ""greatish"" with only a few stellar episodes in each among several that were downright soap opera, Season 7 has been disintegrating into senseless rubble faster than drogon's droppings. Barren of believability, recklessly breaking every temporal and spatial rule it set, as if with zero consequence, rushing through the story while leaving a gazillion plot holes in its wake, filling it with unnecessary scenes (such as Sam's endless potty-cleaning) instead of taking the time to at least work out the relevant story lines; and so it has managed to show something we never expected from its makers: DISRESPECT FOR AUDIENCE INTELLIGENCE. Shame on HBO! ***SPOILERS HERE*** Episode 6 was of course beyond ridiculous - as is being repeatedly mentioned here by others and I will restate some of it just to emphasize the escalating stupidity - we see southerner Gendry (who previously zip-zapped to the north eager to kill the dead though he knows nothing ) now sprint through all that alien northern snow to send a raven, and apparently the raven flies even faster than him to Dragonstone and Dany (herself a first timer to the north) manages to arrive just in time to save the ""magnificent 7-1"" that were basically just standing there all this while staring at the Night King and wights(and we are supposed to believe this happened over few days at least) Furthermore, Drogon is a sitting duck right before the Night King's nose who instead chooses to throw his spear at Viseryon flying in the background. If that's not abusive enough to common-sense, we see Jon urging Dany to depart with other first-time travelers on Drogon 747, while he gets ready to tackle the Night King's army alone (which goes against his reason to travel south and seek help!). And lo and behold, with all the plothole fixing talents of Euron Greyjoy, Uncle Benjen appears out of nowhere among the wights to hand his nephew his horse instead of riding together, that too after a brief hello though they've basically met after a decade. Such nuanced writing - take a bow, morons! ***SPOILERS END***I could keep blaming the writers, but lets face it, if they were that good, they'd have written novels of their own. Its more likely that these people are stuck between D&D, HBO and the audience and face the wrath from all of them alike. Of course, their writing is sloppy and they have largely failed to maintain the depth of first-person narrative in their characters given the lack of source material and imagination (Euron and Gendry have the depth and motivation of plastic toys!), but I understand they are also shortchanged for time, crunched by deadlines and other commitments they need to keep if they are to make a living in Hollywood. So I do feel for them. But HBO, oh shame on HBO! They've tried to milk this cashcow so bad, her udder's run dry. HBO should have known the best thing to do was to take the TV rights to Martin's books but wait for him to have finished the whole ASOIAF before starting the TV series. Now, we have chaos. Only in this case, Chaos isn't a ladder, its a heavy-budgeted slippery story line you're surely tumbling over. The sloppy predictable ruins next season are certain. As a distraught fan, I am just waiting for this misery to end. For now, HBO has its strong senseless fanbase here and elsewhere that find the latest season most ""exciting"" and ""unpredictable"" and give it 10/10 to tell HBO and themselves sweet lies. Stay deluded and hate on those with common-sense. Critically, everything about this show now sucks. I don't care about how well-choreographed your action scenes are. They can't save this ship from sinking.Shame! Shame! Shame!"
582," GoT has dropped to Transformers level
",1,False,"Well, looking at the surprisingly high score and the drastically divided opinions towards this season, I would say that GoT has dropped to Transformers level. This applies to both the quality of the show and its fanbase.The high score owes partially to its brilliant past, but it doesn't mean that in any way it deserves the score it has right now.The writers are great at adapting the books, but they certainly suck at creating based on mere traces. Maybe they would do better if they were not briefed by George R. R. Martin, cuz at least they would not be dancing in fetters.R.I.P. GoT."
583," This is not GoT
",1,False,"The script must have been written by a ten years old, and not a very smart one.For starters, the premise of the episode was totally absurd. Don't get me wrong, I like most of these characters and seeing them together is pretty cool but why risk the best warriors and leaders of Westeros to fetch a zombie on the off chance that it will help convince Cersey - who has never listened to logic anyways? And why send them without a proper plan, without proper wight-killing or wight-capturing device, without as much as a freaking horse(?!) and only a vague idea of where the undead might be?Anyways here we are, so after capturing a wight through sheer luck, the Suicide Squad has the entire undead army on their heels... but fear not, Jon sends Gendri call for help *literally* to the other side of the world.. because he runs marginally faster?? W.T.F.The whole stuck-in-the-lake thing was so improbable, it was ridiculous. And why didn't the zombie throw any projectiles? What about the Night King since apparently he can throw spears at the speed of light? Then Dany drops everything to come save a guy she saw once.. with all her dragons.. like 10 hours later (Westeros is full of worm holes it seems).. but if she was keen to join, why didn't she just do fly-by to grab a wight instead of putting us through this nonsense?The action was predictable to the point of boring, Jon was never gona die on this side quest, pretending he might was a waste of time. Still the writers decided to kill off Benjen to save him to the tune of ""there is no time to climb on the horse"" bullshit.Oh, and where did the chains come from?? weren't the undead scared of water a minute ago? then how did they hook the dragon from the bottom of the lake?The whole thing made no sense, was full of plot holes and plot devices, suspenseless.. boring even, and the outcome was super predictable and frustrating.This didn't feel like a Game of Thrones ep, it felt like some fan- fiction that breaks all the rules of the GoT universe just to get an undead dragon on screen. Even the Sansa-Arya scenes felt weird.What a waste of an episode in this otherwise amazing season."
584," Stunning visuals but non-professional writing
",5,False,"It is well-known that the show is slowly losing its quality since Season 4, when the show runners started to ran out of source material, but this was too much. It seems that they've forgotten about all the smart dialogues, the exceptional characters or the plot twists that made Game of Thrones what it is, and they only care about how to please the audiences. This episode was the peak of the show's downfall, full of poor clichés, silly romance and really, really, really bad writing.First of all, the whole plan of capturing a wight is so stupid. They should realize this is a suicide mission with no chances of success when they were just 12 men (if you count some unnecessary extras who show up just before they die) and had no dragonglass weapons with them (even though Daenerys gave Jon permission to use the dragonglass under Dragonstone). Then there is the super-convenient scene where a group of wights have drawn off the main unit for no reason, and the realization that they just have to kill the white walker leaders for their wights to die (although one wight survives just for them to capture him, super convenient, huh?). Then why do they send Gendry back to Eastwatch again? To inform Danny that they're in danger, basically something that she is already aware of? And for some reason she decides to help them this time. And I don't even want to talk about the super-speed raven and dragons, which manage to reach the team in what seems to be hours or at best a day or two, while the fellowship is just waiting on the rocky island, surrounded by wights, for Danny to save them.And when Daenearys arrives with her dragons is where the true paranoia starts. Why did the Night's King threw his spear on Viserion when Drogon was right behind him and carrying the whole team? why does Jon stay to play the hero killing some more wights for no reason? And just when we were sure that Jon is gonna die (wait, no?) Uncle Benjen comes just in time to save the day (don't even bother asking how he knew where Jon was and why he didn't show up earlier) and stays behind to die an unnecessary death. Jon returns to Eastwatch and they board a ship to return back home (why do they not travel with dragons?) and then we have this awful scene between Jon and Danny, which looks so forced that makes you think you're watching Twilight instead of GoT. However, this episode had its pros too: super effects, scenery porn, good dialogues at most times, good action sequences and the epic dragon's death but these aren't enough to make you overlook the terrible writing and the huge plot holes. The show runners must realize that the fans won't be pleased with huge and epic battles when the writing is so bad. This is not the GoT we all fell in love with!"
585," Wtf
",4,False,In just one episode they made more stupid things then in 7 season before.
586," Not real GoT
",1,False,"I'm sorry, this show should not be as highly rated as it's. There's more to this show than just war, dragons, Jon Snow. It used to have a rich history of houses and it meant something. Now it's just clichés and predictability. There was no reason to try and capture a wight with some of the best warriors in the realm. There was no reason to convince Cersei, someone who doesn't listen to logic. Her entire army was murdered by Dany and her gold destroyed. And Dany for some reason, after massacring the entire army is trying to reason with how she doesn't want to be a fearful ruler. This show is a new level of bad. You're either a hero or a villain, otherwise you're nameless and you're dead. Predictable. Every show does it. No matter who kills them, we should still view the heroes as heroes and villains as villains. We shouldn't care about their lives because they weren't named and it's completely fine if they die because they're not a main character. The wildlings that accompanied Jon past the wall all died, predictable. Nobody cared about them even though some of them were in worse terms with Thoros, nobody interacted with them.They're taking the tension away by constantly saving main characters and most of the theories and detail have been blown out of the water. It's like other characters and stories don't matter anymore, it's just about Jon, Dany and the night king. They could've done so many more unexpected things like they did in seasons 1-3 but they seem to just turn into other TV shows, no tension, main characters winning every time even though heroes and villains are just a matter of perspective which Game of Thrones used to consider very well. Now everybody is just categorized as heroes and villains and they're doing everything in their power to save heroes over and over again from impossible situations. How cool would it have been if Bran used his psychic power to control one of Dany's dragons to assist without Dany's knowledge as the dead ran towards them instead of some bullshit lake that they the wights didn't cross for days because of it being exactly perfect so they couldn't cross but the so called 'heroes' could. Bran can see the future, he saw the army of undead, he controls ravens and could send a message to Jon alerting him of who he is and the dangers he face but he becomes completely irrelevant and his powers have done absolutely nothing to impact the story apart from finding out Jon's a Targaryen. This news only comes at a surprise to the casual viewer who didn't figure this out before and needs to be constantly reminded even though it's been theories for years. As the seasons keep progressing, Game of Thrones keeps becoming a show that the casual viewer wants it to be and not the rich and historical world it used to be. They've lost the immersion of the story. They're making the show for people who want to see war and action, not see a story. As an avid Game of Thrones theorist, who is interested more by the theories, background, histories and prophecies of this world more than the real world, I'm disappointed. Doesn't mean I don't like war, I don't like the war for good and bad like TV shows make it. It's not as simple as good and bad. And we all want to feel the tension that people are in danger when they make mistakes like Ned and Rob, however you've made it so that ""heroes"" can escape the impossible over and over and over and over again. Simply boring. I wish I could rewatch seasons 1-3 over and over again from fresh instead of watching the garbage that GoT is now. It's not GoT anymore in fact, it doesn't deserve such high praise. I don't know who writes this story. It's like they've never even heard of the GoT universe before and they're told:"" Jon needs to go beyond the wall and he needs to survive and make it dramatic"". Even though getting saved over and over again isn't."

589," Visual effects can't compensate horrendous writing
",1,False,"*English is not my first language, I hope you can still understand what I try to say*Over the last weeks it became clear that this season will be an absolute disgrace to everything Game of Thrones ever stood for. In an never ending effort to find new ways of destroying the characters and their story lines, D&D have (yet again) managed to reach a new low point within this season.*SPOILERS START HERE*The starting point of this episode was utterly trash: To convince Cercei (the most egoistic and ruthless character) of the greater threat, they send the most skilled and most important characters (except Gendry, who joined randomly) beyond the wall in the hope that they will stumble upon a small group of wights, but NOT the whole army.Anyway, the premise of this episode has been made in E5, I guess we gotta go with it. Conveniently there team gets supported by the Hound, Beric and Thoros and some extras (otherwise not even D&D could make this suicide mission work). But if you hoped that the execution of the mission is better than the plan itself, the writers will surprise you: Jon and his men go out without horses, without dragon glass they mined earlier, without a map or literally any idea where the army of the dead might be. The only hint they have is the vision the Hound got after he looked into the fire for 2 seconds. After some awkward dialogues and the death of some nameless extras (who apparently were only put into the series to die in place of the main characters), the squad finally finds a small group of enemies just as they needed. Even more conveniently, one single wight survives after Jon killed the white walker. Now we get to the infamous point of massive time bending, where Gendry runs to the wall, sends a hyper sonic raven to Dragonstone, and Dany in turn flies back all within a couple of hours. In the meantime, Jon and his team save themselves to the middle of a frozen lake where the white walkers can't harm them anymore (not even with their magic spears as it seems), and, for the drama, Thoros froze to death (and of course they inflame their swords AFTERWARDS). Smart Jon also rejects the idea of trying to kill the Night King because they ""have to bring the wight south"".Anyways, the Hound then randomly decides to start the fight vs. the dead army on his own and we get to see some action. As expected, nobody important dies in the fight no matter how close or hopeless it may seem. When Dany joins the fight IN THE LAST MOMENT, she of course doesn't target the Night King and the Night King also doesn't target Dany/Drogon (otherwise the series would already be decided for one or the other side), but instead they both aim for the unimportant characters. When Dany is ready to leave, Jon wants to prove his fighting skills and, as it happens, they have to leave him drowning surrounded by enemies. But that's no problem for our hero because he is inexplicably able to pull himself out of the lake and then gets saved by Benjen – again in the last second.Due to the lack of space I can't analyze this plot line any further and also have to skip Winterfell (although it seemed like the producers have no idea what they want to do with Arya and Sansa).Before the conclusion, I want to mention some other decisions that didn't seem convincing in my eyes: Why isn't Bran helping in the fights between Arya/Sansa and Jon/White Walkers? How could Dany know where Jon would be? Where did the Night King get this massive chains from in the last sequence? Why doesn't Dany simply fly north in the first place to convince herself of the Night King safely from afar? What use is it to convince Cersei when she lost her complete army to Dany anyway two episodes ago? Why does Gendry join them in this ridiculous mission if he never even has seen snow before? Why doesn't the Night King care that Jon survived? Why did Benjen suicide although he was able to save Bran AND Meera simultaneously on his horse?Conclusion: This episode was an accumulation of inconsistency, implausible decisions and the massive usage of plot devices (notably time bending and deus ex machina). It's obvious that the producers want the plot to follow a certain direction and sacrificed consistency and coherence for it. The outcome is a season that feels unnatural, crooked and rushed compared to the earlier seasons."
590," A sweet sorrow of ice and fire
",10,True,"By watching this episode, I realized that there will never be an epic series such as Game of Thrones. So, I'm asking everyone to try and appreciate what's left of this masterpiece.This episode marks two different stories running simultaneously, which is pretty standard on Game Of Thrones this season. The Magnificent Seven are north of The Wall, looking for the army of the dead, and the two Stark daughters are at one another's throats thanks to some clever manipulation courtesy of Littlefinger, who has never met a person he wouldn't stab in the back. Despite the seven's hunt for a wight involving several action scenes, the moments that stick in the mind longest actually involve the characters interacting with one another; despite mostly being two people talking to one another, the scenes in Winterfell stick in the mind for the simmering undercurrent of violence with every interaction between Sansa and Arya.I loved all the dialogue between Jon and his posse. I loved how Tormund poked and prodded at the Hound, who cursed him back with his typical snarling impatience. The Brienne exchange was laugh-out- loud funny but later, when it looked almost certain that Tormund would be one of the casualties, it's the Hound who saves him.The battle was utterly mesmerizing. I was on the edge of my seat more than once, and thought for sure we'll lose many characters by the end of the night, but I'm frankly astonished that the show didn't kill off Beric and Tormund.Dany and her three dragons swoop in and burn hundreds of wights and thaw the lake to keep Jon and company safe. Jon's foolish honor keeps him fighting and struggling when he should be joining the rest on the back of the dragon trying to escape. Jon is rescued from certain death by a returning uncle Benjen, who promptly sends Jon away on his horse while squaring off with wights and getting ready to fulfill his unnatural purpose by dying so that others might live.Watching the dragon go careening out of the sky and landing in the frozen lake is awesome in the truest sense of the word. It inspires awe, in this case awe at the skill of the special effects crew to animate not only the dragon, but the gushers of dragon blood spraying out of it as it falls to earth. The dragon doesn't stay dead for long. After all, we've already been shown an ice bear, horses and giants. The pacing is masterful; we hold on a shot of the wights dragging giant frozen chains, slowly a giant dragon corpse rises into view, and then the Night's King steps across the field to lay one hand on the giant dead snout of Viserion.The cinematography and action were all spectacular and the shots of the snow-swept land beyond the Wall were just beautiful. One thing Game of Thrones has done incredibly well this season is making dragons really awesome. And I mean awesome in its true sense; awe-inspiring, jaw-dropping, epic and glorious. I'm not sure I've ever witnessed such cool dragons in any TV show or movie before. Jon and Daenerys conversation was epic and one of the most emotional scenes of the series if not the best. How else do you get Jon to wake up in a comfy bed with Daenerys sitting over him, nursing him back to life? How else do you stage this tender moment? He even calls her ""Dany"" which I actually liked, though she tells him only her creepy brother called her that. They hold hands, and he calls her his queen with him barely speaking.+Spectacular cinematography+Escalating events+Whits fight+Daenerys entry+Jon and Daenerys epic conversation+The Ice Dragon10/10"
591," S7 wasn't perfect, but compared to S8 it is a masterpiece
",9,True,"Writing this before S8E6 aka the final episode.Season 7 had it's problems for sure, but if we only knew what will come upon us in S8 we would endlessly praise it for it's glorious writing.This is where the show should have ended, and it should be left for GRR Martin to finish his books before start filming again.
Character arcs were still untouched and we had high hopes for ending.Final season, the way it was written, completely destroyed the show."
592," The Great War is Here
",10,True,"It's not like tonight provided any classic Game of Thrones 'shocker' moments. In reality, we knew Cersei wasn't actually going to go along with the truce, we figured Littlefinger would meet his end sooner rather than later, it was all but confirmed that Jon was the son of Rhaegar and Lyanna, and it was inevitable that the wall (or one section of the wall) was going to come down by season's end. So really, the 4 biggest shocks or twists from the episode weren't all that surprising, but it's the execution that counts. If there's one thing that Game of Thrones always does right, it's the execution.Starting off in King's Landing, because everything always comes back there, we got at least a half an hour of extraordinary direction and writing. I think a lot of people have complained about this season revolving around dialogue instead of things actually happening, but I eat all this dialogue up. How can you not appreciate all of the brilliant blocking in the dragon pit? There's so many dynamics, so many reunions, and so many important meetings. The Hound and The Mountain, Theon and Euron, Jaime and Brienne, and of course the long- awaited meeting between Daenerys and Cersei. There's so much to cover in such little time, and I thought the writers handled it brilliantly. We didn't get Cleganebowl, but everyone did finally see the real threat that's out there. The moment that everyone sees that wight is probably the most significant thing to happen on this show to date (which has been said a lot the past two seasons). All the back and forth, including an emotional discussion between Tyrion and Cersei, led to the result of Cersei ultimately agreeing to fight alongside Dany & company in the great war. Only to then secretly betray them. Classic Cersei. Luckily, Jaime finally gathered up the strength to go against his sister and love of his life, to head north to fight. It's the redemption we've all wanted from him from the get-go. By the way, where's Bronn? I don't believe I saw him join Jaime so we can only assume he's chilling in some brothel somewhere. Meanwhile, everyone made their way back up north traveling via boat (and not dragonback). This is where we find Jon and Daenerys doing what some people have wanted them to do for a very long time. I'm honestly not sure how I feel about it. It's disgusting for one, but this is a fantasy show that has presented such intimate relationships more of the norm than it should be. Plus, it's not like these characters know that they're related.yet. Yes, Bran has finally spilled the beans. God knows why he told Sam of all people and not his own siblings. But I guess they had their own quarrels to worry about. Speaking of which.Rest in peace Littlefinger! Well, sort of. It's not like he was a good person, in fact, he rarely ever did anything of value. But I will definitely miss his character, and I'll certainly miss Aidan Gillen, who's one of the few original cast members to die in the past few seasons. Which brings up that ""issue"" if you can call it that. How is this show going to service all of the remaining characters and their inevitable deaths in a mere 6 episodes next season? I think there's maybe a dozen characters, maybe, who are safe till the end of the show's run. But I can imagine at least a couple every episode being killed off next season. I don't think I can wait 2 years for that.Things to look forward to next year: Jaime fighting with the good guys! Jon finding out the truth. Cersei messing everything up. The Night King kicking a**. The inevitable queen-slayer moment. Arya crossing a few more names off her list? And of course, Jon being too damn honorable. Oh and by the way, it's snowing in King's Landing. It was a quick season, but definitely one of the best ones yet, if not the best. Let's hope next season gets here faster than we think.+Starks finally stick together+Everyone in King's Landing+Cersei stays evil+Jaime's redemption begins+Jon & Dany+Baelish says farewell+Down goes the wall10/10"
593," Season 7 through the eyes of somebody who loved the first 4 seasons
",8,True,"Season 7 was a letdown for me. I became accustomed to the unpredictability, which has disappeared the moment they ran out of source material. Now it feels more like a high budget Hollywood flick, where none of its major characters are in any real danger,where everything is fan fiction and where you get the feeling everything happens and is shot purely to make merchandise from it.(For example The fake tension at the frozen lake, where you get sad music, a shot of how defeated they are, followed with a faceshot of every character, so people would think they're in trouble, just to be saved a la deus ex machina- The way it was shot, I couldn't stop thinking of marvel's avengers)Overall I liked some of the reunions, it had some great visual effects and beautiful scenery, but as I said, the excitement is gone; it has become yet another predictable television show that doesn't dare to make major leaps.Negative: Tormund should have died in the 'true north', The Littlefinger plot was a real disappointment, The fasttraveling made me motion sick, The whole capturing a whight to convince Cersei was horrible. Some scenes were just there to mislead the audience (E.g. Arya and Sansa). I literally cringed during the last 2 episodesPositive:The Visuals and CGI was good. Performances by most of the actors (especially the Lannister cast) was on point as usual. There were some satisfying reunions and interactions.Overall it's worth watching, but don't expect it to be the same as previous seasons."
594," A few quick words on ""Game of Thrones"" Season 7 (2017)
",10,True,"After finishing its seventh season, I've reached the point where I'd name ""Game of Thrones"" as the best fantasy I've ever read or seen. It's also among the best television I've ever seen, period. I'd cheerfully rate this penultimate season a perfect 10.I do understand some of the criticisms I've read from other fans. Yes, this shorter, more eventful, seven-episode arc could seem a little rushed when compared with prior seasons. And certain plot points in the last several episodes here are easy to nitpick.But I can't give less than a perfect rating to a show that I enjoyed this much. Season 7 added great action and special effects, lots of momentum, frightening horror, and some long-awaited conclusions to story arcs that began back in Season 1. And the show still has the best dialogue of any current television show that I'm aware of, usually supported by terrific acting.I won't say more for fear of spoilers. But I obviously loved this season."
595," Absolutely incredible
",10,True,"I'm still shaking from how good this episode was. This is simply one of the best episodes this show has ever had. The tension and intensity starts at the beginning and never lets up. The scene in the dragon pit with all the main characters is executed extremely well. The acting, music, and cinematography is absolutely perfect. Littlefinger's death is shocking and awesome, and I never knew how much I wanted him dead until I saw Arya slit his throat. There's finally some redemption for Theon and for Sansa. Then we get to the climax where Cercei reveals that she staged the meeting and never intends to honor her commitment, and finally Jaimie decides he's had enough of her betrayals and leaves. These scenes with Jaimie and Cercei are very powerful, and watching him ride into the winter free from her control is awesome. Then Bran and Sam find out the truth about Jon's heritage: he is the son of Rhaegar and Lyanna, making him the true heir of the iron throne. This scene is done beautifully, with Bran witnessing Rhaegar and Lyanna's wedding while at the same time, Jon and Dany finally get together. And finally, we have the destruction of the wall by the Night King. The CGI of wight Viserion is breathtaking, and the final moments of the show where the dragon burns the wall are the perfect way to end an incredible season. If season 8 is as good as (or better than) season 7, Game of Thrones will go down as the best TV show ever. 10/10"
596," A mediocre episode to end a mediocre season
",6,False,"I have to say, after last episode I was very disappointed with the show and I began to see the cracks that this season had all along. Plot holes, poor writing, contrivances, nonsensical character motivations, etc, but this had it all.Before I begin I want to say that this episode actually had some fantastic parts to it. The dragonpit was executed marvelously, we saw some great heart to heart moments between the lannisters, Jon being Jon, Winter finally arriving. However, this does not do enough to overshadow just how many problems there was. Let's address the biggest first. My review will focus on the negatives, the positives will be outlined by the many ""10/10 BEST EPISODE EVER IM CRYING AND SHOCKED"" reviews by fanboys.The Winterfell Plot: Up until this season I believed that the Dorne saga was as low as the show could possibly sink, but boy was I wrong. Today's episode cements the plot as the currently worst plot line of the entire show. We see it end with a plot twist that Sansa and Arya were ""just kidding"" with their little rivalry just to play littlefinger. While this sounds fun, the biggest question is... why? There is no good reason for this at all, if their intention was to do this from the start they had plenty of evidence to begin with: starting with Bran the Plot Visioned-Three eyed raven. Sure this gives the sisters a nice little fist pumping GIRL POWER moment for some, but for me this is just cringe worthy awful (yes, I actually cringed when watching a Game of Throne scene). It all ends with Little finger putting on a pathetic display, and all this set up for his character was for nothing. In the end he became irrelevant, but of course the writers HAD to come up with a way for him to go out. However, this was the worst. Moving on, let's address another sub-plot: The Jon-Dany romance. This was a romance that was shipped from the moment we saw them, and so many fan theories led to it happening. Well, it happened, but not in a way that was good. This is party due to less screen time, but we never really saw them fall in love. It felt extremely forced, and we only got hints of it when their aides told them they were staring at the other. Next up, they're basically wanting to bang each other in episode six, and here it happens, only it's weird. Not because of the incest thing (I'll get to that in a minute), but just how it happens. Jon just appears at her door and boom they have sex. Given how little build up we've scene between them, you'd think a little chat before hand would be prudent to give it some life, but nah let's show them bang. But wait, there's more: It's only for 20 seconds then cut away, and its more censored a PG-13 movie. Since when was Game of Thrones shy of showing sexual content? I'm not arguing for a porn scene but for real this is GoT, we don't need to be hidden from the dangers of fornication! Finally, I just want to point out that Grey worm and Missandei, who had the most pointless romance in the show, has 5 minutes of screen time for their love scene while Jon and Dany, the most important arguably, get's less than a minute. Think about that.Next up: Jon is a Targaryan! - Who really saw this as a surprise at this point? The show didn't which actually is fine, and we actually saw Bran and Sam reunite which was actually one of the better parts of the episode, until the conversation came to Jon. Just as soon as Bran mentions Jon is a tagaryan and a sand, Sam immediately chips in that he's not and actually is a targaryan thanks to what was written in the High Priest's log.Now, I'm not doubting Sam's memory here, I'm doubting his level as a human. His best friend just got revealed to be, I don't know, the heir to the entire kingdom and he shows NO reaction at all? This isn't the fault of the actor, this is the writing not allowing him to react. Clearly they wanted to get through their dialogue so they could show their PG-13 love scene and montage, but for god's sake allow your characters to be real for once, that's what made the show awesome in the first place, because this scene felt like the narrator was speaking the dialogue and not Sam and Bran.Finally: The wall --> This also wasn't that poorly handled and was cool, we got to see zombie viscerion spit blue fire and the wall come down, while Tormund and Beric look down in terror. See, this scene was already impactful, but the writers took it away when it broke the rule of Game of Thones: As little to no plot armor as possible. Tormund already got a taste of death last episode but escaped thanks to the writers catering to fanboys, but magically he escaped again thanks to the wall falling down just short of where he ran from. Plot armor strikes again! You know, if it wasn't another close call I wouldn't be complaining as much, but all these close calls and nobody of consequence actually dying just makes those close calls mean nothing.All together, I didn't hate this episode, but I didn't love it. It was just OK, and had the same problems this entire season had. I'm still going to watch, but I'm not going to expect the show to be anywhere as good as it was before, because clearly we're down to having just pure CGI but no substance beneath it, and sadly the fanboys will lap it up as gold."
597," GOT writing died at season 6
",6,False,"The reason this shows was populor was because it gave a realistic feeling of fantasy world. I am very disappointed with Season 7, poor story writing, too much rush, predictable story, too many plot holes and lack of sensational music which all made it the best show so far. I am a big fan of GOT but season 7 was honestly very disappointing."
598," Cringing wolf, risen dragon
",3,False,"Does one minute at the end make up for about 75 minutes of cringe addressed to the braindead? Of course not. This episode deserves less than 3/10, I just refuse to rate any episode worse than what I rated s05e09.Diplomacy for dummiesThe episode begins with the meeting between the Lannisters and the alliance of ""good"" guys. After a few dialogues between old acquaintances that will make you nostalgic for George Lucas, they present the wight to Cersei. The sight is shocking to everyone around, despite the extremely obvious fact that UNDEAD BUTCHER GREGOR CLEGANE is standing literally next to them. I honestly thought Cersei would say ""Big deal, Qyburn can make an army of these guys in a week"", but no. Euron Greyjoy declares this is the most terrifying thing ever, despite UNDEAD BUTCHER GREGOR CLEGANE standing right there. Sure, Euron's reaction is later revealed to be an utterly pointless ruse, but the confusion remains. The truce is spoiled by Jon not wanting to break a vow *for this night and all nights to come* - OK, he died, let's say he hasn't broken this vow *king in the north who bends the knee without telling anyone first*. But it is fixed by Tyrion who convinces Cersei to help...somehow. This is later revealed to be a ruse too: Cersei doesn't intend to help. She could have taken the truce and the result would be the same, but no. Instead she lies about helping and perhaps no one will notice she lied for another few days. Can you spell ""moronic"", Benioff?Character AssassinationIn the same atrocious scene where Cersei reveals her inconceivably useless lie, Jaime leaves her. D&D sent 5 seasons of Jaime's character development down the drain to have him revert back to a guy who wants to bang his sister, but now he's had the last straw. He can't break his promise. Do you remember that superb monologue in the bath with Brienne? D&D don't. It contained too many big words and made their brains hurt.Storytelling is a ladder...and if you are as terrible at it as Benioff and Weiss, you will fall down like a sack of potatoes. Petyr Baelish has stopped being a master of manipulation for a while, being replaced by an idiot whose schemes don't make any sense. Now, in a shocking (not) twist, he is executed for his crimes in inglorious fashion because this is a show where bad guys get punished now. Somehow, murder helps the Stark sisters make up as unreasonably as they were arguing.I know everything - what do you want?The Baelish trial is conducted with zero evidence, instead everyone takes the word of Bran Stark - who knows and sees everything, but still needs to ask a whole lot. I can't tell if the writers actually think this is what the 3-eyed-crow does or just thought this wasn't a horrible, horrible plot device. To make - it is possible - matters worse than having a guy reveal impossible to know information whenever convenient because of reasons, omniscient Bran asks for something and when answered gains access to video footage, used to tell us that Jon is not even illegitimate, because Rhaegar *vomit* married Lyanna after getting a divorce without telling his wife. And gave him the same name as his other son.Cringus MaximusIt is hard to find a more forced and unconvincing romance than that between Jon and Daenerys. Double cringe if you despise her character. Maximise cringe when realising that it only exists to service the worst of all fans.Oh and by the waythe Wall falls by dragon-riding Night's King. Could be a great scene, but by that point you are so buried in cringe you hardly care.PS. Minor notes: 1. at the very beginning, Greyworm appears. Last we saw him he had taken Casterly Rock with only a few men, but when the ironborn came and burned their ships, they apparently let everyone go. 2. Theon Balboa. One can't help but laugh at how Theon gets his ass kicked and then knocks the guy down with one hit."

",10,True,"NO NO NO !!! Please someone tell me this is not the end. What was that? How can i describe this episode? From where do i start? Can i say it was perfect? No, because even the word perfect doesn't do justice for this unbelievable episode. That was really HUGE. THIS is how you end a season. This is how a season finale should be done. For me, The Dragon and the Wolf is the best episode to date, HANDS DOWN. Cinematic, unpredictable (for those who haven't read the leaked plot), incredibly thrilling, and it felt like an episode from the earlier seasons with a GRRM touch. It had everything we could have hoped for and more. it was packed with satisfying moments, emotional scenes, conclusions and managed to set up the finale season perfectly. Everything was incredible in every possible way.Ramin Djawadi, Thank you sir, as always you didn't disappoint us, the soundtrack made every scene more and more emotional.A special thanks to David Benioff and D.B Weiss for delivering us such an amazing and epic season. They did a spectacular job and we congratulate them for their success. BIG THANKS TO THEM <3So this is it. THE END, season 7 gave us everything we've ever wanted. Sadly, we have to wait until late 2018 for the series final season which it will only include 6 episodes, how painful. SUNDAYS WILL NEVER BE THE SAME AGAIN, Goodbye GoT .. You'll be missedAND NOW OUR WATCH BEGINS.10000/10."
600," A Hollywood tune. Suspension of disbelief fail.
",3,False,"Once upon a time, back in season 2, I predicted that the series would end with Danaerys and Jon marrying each other. Then I discarded that idea, because it was too obvious and Martin too intelligent. I termed it a red herring (false lead). I still hope it's a red herring, but nowadays I am starting to become afraid, that Hollywood has dumbed down a great world to its own inferior intelligence standards.The series as a whole is great. This episode too has many high points. It was time well spent watching. But, WHY?!? Why go and F up a beautiful series with such a dumb twist.

All Jon's warnings in the previous seasons mean nothing because his and Daenerys's intervention led to zombie disaster. 2. I don't understand why writers forgot about the Watchers. They were the first line in the Wall protection. Why Jon forgot so fast his watcher's past and was trying to consolidate the South instead of the Night watch reinforcement?? Eventually according to story if he did nothing, the Wall fall wouldn't have happened. 3. The death of Littlefinger was so artificial. He died because writers must have killed this character. The Littlefinger was the most powerful intriguer in Westeros and his death was so simple and unnatural.4. Bran Stark turn into unbelievably boring character. I knew it, I saw it, I see everything etc. And no any benefits from his skills. 5. In the end, creators decided to kill us by disgusting love scene between Jon and Daenerys and peeking Tyrion...nooo...

As I was watching I couldn't help but get excited, but then quickly realised I just witnessed blatant abuse of my own and others' fascination and love for a great story.I haven't read the books (I hope those who have can take refuge in them), but I very much enjoyed the way an intricate world was meticulously built up and used as stage for incredible plots, twists, battles, and great character development (which was all the more satisfying as characters we'd been led to believe were 'main' got swatted like flies, and others stepped forward).The TV show did a great job of all this, but then at some point (perhaps when running out of book material) decided to (or could only manage to) pump this delicate foundation for cheap thrills and fan service, glossed over with spectacular Hollywood action scenes. Plot lines carefully laid over years have been torn up and clumsily tied together for the sake of some ""awesome scenes"", and nothing has been done protect the integrity of the GoT world or story. After this episode there is little left to excite anyone - who honestly cares about any of the characters anymore? All that's waiting for us is a clash of living vs dead - it's like we're all incredibly excited to see the next crappy zombie movie to come out.The show has plenty of momentum left for a chance to redeem itself, but it will take hard work to patch together something respectable from the rubble left by these last episodes."

There was no illogical scenario, all the conversations made perfect sense and were completely on point (thanks to the writers!).Everything that happened in this episode, was absolutely unpredictable and masterfully set up. A perfect ending to a (not just as perfect) season of Game of Thrones.PS.: Somehow I knew Sansa and Arya were toying with Littlefinger but when Arya came into the hall I seriously thought she was gonna die, god I was happy to see that kind of a twist.

",1,False,"So night king finally destroyed the wall because of Jon Snow. Jon made Daenerys and 3 dragons flew beyond the wall. So night king has the chance to kill one and used it to burn down the wall. In other words, if there is no Jon Snow, everybody still lives happily behind the wall at least for now.One episode made the king of the north a complete loser but sadly it is not the worst part.They got one dragon killed just for a zombie to show Cersei so they can ally with her and fight dead. Let's get it straight if night king wins, Cersei just needs to find an island to survive. If Jon and Daenerys win, they will chase her down and kill her. Cersei's brother killed Daenerys' father. Her son killed Jon's father. She basically crashed Stark family in previous seasons and she is the top one target on Arya's list. This is just super personal. If it is me, I would rather ally with night king.Everything in this episode just looks so stupid. They want to scare Cersei with a walking dead. But they brought two beast dragons to show her as well. I bet Cersei was thinking dead people walking around so what? There are two f*** beasts flying around my house.Jon Snow's honest is another joke here. Cersei asked him not to take a side. But Jon said no and blah blah blah. In translation, he said Cersei, you help us to kill dead and we will kill you after that. In the context of Jon was hoping to ally with Cersei so badly even taking risk of his own life and cost a dragon, and saying these words to her face but still expecting her to fight with him. I don't know if it is stupid or selfish. It is absolutely pathetic. Anyway, thanks to the writer for made a hero of 7 seasons to a retarded loser in one episode."
608," i hate the new GoT
",1,False,"it's obvious, it's desperate that this show needs the iron fist of GRRM. When the script lacks him, we can tell... It was a crowd pleasing episode, this is not the GoT i'm used to in the season finales. In here we had a cliché story we all waited it to happen: Jon getting in bed with Daenerys, The Night King destroying the wall, Cersei not accepting to help them (wow, i wasn't expecting that, at all...), Sansa & Arya conspiring to catch and sentence little finger...BORING!!where's the action? where are the sudden deaths? the ruthless cruel reality of the royalty? the interesting character development?GoT has been squished and exploited to a point it's not as awesome as it used to be anymore. Admit it guys, it was a great risk to take the story to the side of the winter zombies, it is pretty intense and interesting BUT! if you writers, focus on that storyline, what else do we have??? we have nothing! everyone else who was interesting is dead or not in the main focus by now!! Olenna, Margaery, Samwell, Yara, Arya, Varys...Also, the Stark sisters and Bran are together but, they contribute nothing to the story. OK awesome they're in Winterfell... and so what? i prefer Bran to be beyond the wall fighting and having visions, Arya killing bad people and Sansa struggling but getting on with it. Together they're boring as f*ck.they joined every relevant character together to add suspense and intensity, but instead we had a chipboard of awesome characters who can be totally exploited by separate story lines in different locations with total action and awesomeness... they're being totally wasted!for the next season, i can tell: of course Jon's winning but a main character is going to die. If he dies again, it won't be as intense as the first time so it'll be probably Daenerys or Tyrion. Aaaand if they lose we end the show with a hopeless finale, who we were also expecting; it has to be a balance for all the fan/crowd pleasing main events of this last season.IT'S JUST MEH. I think Twin Peaks episode of last Sunday was way better than this one. For the first time since it started, Got has become generic and predictable. They made a very long and not active enough season finale to keep me on the edge of my seat.I'm not interested in what may happen next, OK so maybe Cersei wins, who cares. Maybe everyone dies. I don't care. Everything has become predictable. Everything GRRM created and carefully crafted with a lot of time, patience and years, has been ruined. Sadly, it had such potential of running this show WAY longer with a better storyline. Really saddens me, it was a beautifully made television program. This was quality in everything you see: scenario, costumes, performances AND story...that's where the strong point were. Not anymore. RIP GoT"
609," Negotiations take place in the capital, Bran and Sam talk about stuff and the Whitewakers feature.
",10,True,"Utterly breathtaking, this episode got increasingly better as it went on ending with as high as any film or TV as gone before. The plot, acting, cinematography, music and camera work were sublime.One of the best episodes yet and to do this without a large scale battle scene. Plot twists keep you sitting up and talking to your TV. It simply doesn't get better than this."
610," Season Finale
",9,True,"Game of Thrones concluded its penultimate season with an episode that featured reveals, callbacks and some remarkable visuals.The final battle scene with The White Walkers and their new secret weapon was incredible. We know they won't prevail, but we have to see how the good guys come up with a way to beat them next season. It was a heartbreaking moment to see such an iconic character to this world be used for evil. We saw an individual who evaded punishment and death so many times finally meet his maker.This had drama, some action, it was everything a season finale should be."
611," Jon Snow's Lineage
",10,True,"In King's Landing, Daenerys, Jon Snow and Cersei have a tense meeting where they show a wight to Cersei that does not accept the proposed armistice. However, Tyrion has a private encounter with her and she changes her position. At Winterfell, Sansa brings Arya to accomplish a death penalty for murder and treason. Then Samwell has a meeting with Bran and they discuss Jon Snow's lineage. At Eastwatch, the Night King riding his dragon and the White Walker army attack the Wall. ""The Dragon and he Wolf"" is another excellent episode of the Seventh Season of ""Game of Thrones"". The only remark is the discussion of on Jon Snow's lineage that deserved to be longer and better explained. But every segment is great and shows surprises, like Cersei and Sansa's decisions. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""The Dragon and the Wolf"""
612," Really bad fan-fiction.
",1,False,"As far as I'm concerned this series jumped the shark in season 5, this has devolved into really, really, bad/horrid fan-fiction. There are more potholes in the last two seasons to list (what happened to the Bolton soldiers dogs when they tracked down Sansa, how can ravens fly at Mach 5, since when is swimming a mile upstream in armor not just possible but easy, why would a reanimated dragon breath fire when fire kills the reanimated? Wouldn't a dragon that appears to have ice as part of its new body composition breath ice? Can anyone say ice dragon?? Etc, etc. This is not just horrid fan-fiction, it's horrid fan-fiction written by a not so bright 10 year old. Sad!!!!"
613," Boring finale
",4,False,"Spoilers ahead Let's start of with best things about the episode . 1. Lena, Peter, Sophie and Littlefinger S acting. 2. Cinematography as always 3. Costumes 4. Loved the end sequence when snow fall on Jaime's hand and then on entire kings landing nice direction.But actor and directors are nothing if story is not compelling or believable. So many characters are acting unnaturally and some plot lines are really stupid!! To start off in dragon pit Cersei asks Jon for allegiance, which he denies fair enough ;but he denies it for loyalty to his new found crush (phew ) !!! Instead of how about I would never side with her because her son killed my father and you father kill my brother and you tortured my sister . How about I am the who can fight this battle of dead and u r in no position to put terms.!!! cersei/Tyrion/Jamie :Cersei meets Tyrion threatens him but doesn't kill him . OK bit unbelievable but possible . Point to be noted she doesn't kill the brother whom she hates and then in next scene she threatens Jaime whom she loves and haS child with !!! .I bit annoyed that show runners chucked the part when Tyrion tells Jaime about Cersei S unfaithfulness to him as in the book ,such an important point how can they ignore it! It has dragged Jaime and Cersei's story so much. FiNALLY Jaime has left her🙄Bran OK this three eyed raven thing is totally messed up . He conveniently seems some things and completely doesn't know about others!! he came to know Jon's name is aegon when lyanna told this to Ned that means he already knew that Jon is targaren back in last season's finale coz that's when he saw this moment. Then why in he is telling Sam Jon is a sand !!! This is stupidest thing on show even worse than Jon beyond the wall expedition!!!! Really disappointed.Now Jon and Dany:From the start of this season they want us to believe that Jon and Dany are falling in love . And even though it's an incest ppl start shipping them coz Martin's primary characterisations makes us really believe that these two can undeniably fall in love if they ever meet.. But how can show creators turn these character's intimate scene into horrific cliffhanger. First of all nothing about the scene was surprisingly because audience already knew about Jon's parentage but at very least they creators could have showed some sensitivity to this scene and characters .They could have made the scene more inclined towards love than passion. Jon and Dany hardly said a word before getting in the bed!!! Made the audience feel what the hell have I been watching!!!( For 7 years'!!)🙈🙈Writers of the show have messed up story too much.. This is turning into Cinderella's story in reverse but absolutely gone wrong🙄🙄 (ie. Jon being Cinderella 😜) There is unnecessary drama without growth in characters or story . Entire season could have been finished in 3 episodes. At times story is taking idiotic turns . Really disappointing :( I am just glad I saw entire series after season 6 aired wasted just a couple of months than years 😂😂😂"
614," We warmed up!
",8,True,"Opening credits! The change in the credits has been nice. There were radical changes and the icons had changed. The details of the ice from the broken wall to the south were very nice. I liked the new credits. In this episode, there were parallel things about the first episode of the series. In the first episode of the series, Robert Baratheon was coming to Winterell and Bran was watching the armies from the tower. In this episode, one child climbed up the trees and watched Daenerys's army. Even the music used on the stage was the same. The reaction of the northern people to the dragon was fun. The scene of Cersei and Euron Greyjoy was a short, good and consistency. It was a scene I never expected. Theon Greyjoy's rescue of Yara was one of my favorite scenes. The scene where Jon Snow flew with dragon was very fast and a bit simple. I think it should have been more difficult. It made me feel like something Jon was always doing. The most critical part of the episode was to Jon learned that was the true heir to the throne. I wish we could see the elephants. Unfortunately they did not. Actually, it was an episode to warm the fans. This episode reminded us what kind of history the characters has with whom. 8/10"
615," Underwhelming, bordering on disappointing
",7,False,"We got a very tepid start for the last season of one of the greatest shows of the decade, and it seems this season will suffer from the same deficiencies of Season 7, namely, absolutely terrible pacing, mediocre writing and predictability. I think the magic of the earlier seasons are definitively gone at this point.All those problems stem from the fact that there is no longer any source material. Instead of condensing an already fantastic series of books, now the writing team is tasked with filling gaps and turning an outline into a coherent narrative. And thus, all the deficiencies (such as tropes, gaping plot holes, and predictability) of standard Hollywood screenwriting became apparent the in last couple of seasons.Many central characters such as Tyrion, the Hound, Daenerys and Jon Snow have progressively lost key aspects of their personality and become run-of-the-mill tropes. The terrible pacing simply exacerbates this issue as the show-runners attempt to go through a ""check list"" and juggle so many different arcs in a 45-50 min episode. The result is a complete lack of depth, character development, and very short scenes, and we the audience simply can't get as emotionally invested in the characters as before.But, we can expect some key revelations tying up the story and fantastic CGI dragons and battles, so this will definitely be entertaining just not on par with earlier seasons."
616," You can tell they have run out of books
",7,False,"Its not bad, it is just becoming very blank, what made GOT GOT is lost.
It's very sad they ran out of books and it seems without that guidance they are turning to classic hollywood style of filming.
Caracters have lost their identities, they are just a pale version of themselves and everything is filled up with predictable conversations seen in thousand hollywood movies.
Season 7 all over again.
GRRM why didn't you finish the books? Lol"
617," An extension of the tone of Season 7
",5,False,"I'm not so sure anymore... I've been binge-ing the earlier seasons in anticipation of this episode, and whilst I was sure even while watching Season 7 that there was something drastically wrong with the pacing and writing of it, now more than ever the lack of quality is crystal clear.Having just finished episode 1 of season 8 (weren't all these episodes supposed to be an hour-and-a-half long?), I feel a little disheartened. Not much happens in this episode, and that's fine, I am all for holding the action back and ramping up the drama leading up to it... however it's the same issues as Season 7 - the writing feels unintentionally comic, at times. The moments we all expect to see, unfold on screen in the most obvious manner possible. It conveniently cuts between different sequences to keep all storylines moving forward (of course, that has always been a pattern, but it never felt this constructed before). The characters seem to be wrapping up a major Hollywood Fantasy Blockbuster rather than the Game of Thrones we have grown to love and adore.I felt no emotion, just a smile here or there, which can't be helped... these are people I've spent the last 10 years with, even if they are delivering corny lines with a straight, serious face, I can't help but admire where they have reached in this tremendous journey.They do leave you with an interesting cliffhanger, where, for a second, I genuinely got excited about the moments that would follow... and were they the 1.5-hour episodes I was expecting, it may even have delivered some strong punches. But alas, in true Hollywood-Netflix-binge style, the only moment which carried within in some fire and some potential to get the heart racing... the screen cuts to black following a dramatic eye-exchange between two characters we love, and the credits roll."
618," Should've been much better (very mediocre)
",6,False,"The episode doesn't tell you very much, like, even if you didn't watch it, nobody could spoil you anyways because everything that happens in the episode was anticipated already before the season.All that we've seen in the episode should've been in the trailer for the season. And to waste a WHOLE episode on ""few reunion scenes"", out of 6 episodes, that's too much wasted time.The episode is NOT bad, it's just not what you would EXPECT from the opening of the FINAL season of (considered by most) the ""BEST"" tv show nowadays..."
619," I like GOT, but....
",7,False,"This was a rather slow episode, more of a build up to the upcoming war. With so few episodes left, I feel they wasted a lot of time on nothing... just my opinion, no haters needed."
620," Not the best.
",6,False,"Some very predictable scenes and awful, cheesy dialogue. Last 20 minutes were Game of Thrones standard, not quite sure what the first 40 were about."
621," Underwhelming
",2,False,"This was a filler episode. As far as the story goes, the only thing of significance to the plot that happened was Theon's rescue of Yara. Well, I suppose that was significant. It would have been a lot more significant if the Battle of Winterfell had been lost. It's not explained how Theon was able to rescue Yara from the flagship of a massive fleet, but okay.The sequence with Danyeras' army coming to Winterfell was not bad, conceptually... but it felt like a squandered opportunity. The characters said nothing important. They just like cracking boring jokes, making blatantly obvious, but apparently clever remarks, and acting smug and elitist towards a people who are rightfully suspicious of MORE armies coming to their sorrowful lands.It's a bit depressing that Sansa comes off as the most lordly and wise character among this pitiful assortment, since her most notable accomplishments in life have been alternating between being tormented and being rescued. I mean, her character is probably the most successful of the episode, but it doesn't seem quite right. Probably just because of the way everyone else is acting.It seemed pretty reasonable at first that the northern lords should bow to Danyeras, but she acts so annoying that it really does cause instant dislike...
""what do dragons eat?""
""whatever they want"" /smugface
Seriously... that was a reasonable question. Whatever.The plot thread with Lord Umber was a waste of time. I'm not sure why they sent the child back into the growing night at such a late hour. Did they just resent him because of his House's support for the Boltons? Let's be honest, it was just an excuse to cram the episode full of more filler. The jolly company teleports to Last Hearth to search for him, I guess? I didn't know what was happening. Did my TV turn off? Because I can't see a thing, I don't know where they are supposed to be, and I don't know why they are there since nobody mentioned anything about this prior to it happening. Thank goodness for Beric Dondarrion's flashlight sword or I would have just stared into a black screen for the entirety of the ""Last Hearth"" scene.
What was the point of the scene anyways? ""It's a message from the Night King."" Ohhhh, okay. Mr. Night King wanted to say, yo dudes, I'm freaking spooky, I nail children to walls, ooooh. Is this to convince us that the Night King is the bad guy? Seriously, how does this advance the plot at all? It just makes it make less sense. Because if the Night King's army is already past Last Hearth, why would he go to the trouble to leave a message for the heroes to find? I guess he knew they would come looking for Insignificant Character #002789.. oh, I mean Ned Umber.. and so he would go to the trouble to make his sigil out of body parts so the heroes would know that he was a real spooky dude. Why? The Night King never even speaks, but he has enough of a personality to leave sadistic modern art laying around? If he knew someone would find his ""message"", then why would he not have some wights lying in wait to kill the heroes that he knew would come there and become stuck in the middle of his advance? Hmm. Doesn't really make sense.
And then they make a point of saying they only have a few horses and they'll have to ride double and try to ride hard to get past World War Z. Then it's never mentioned again. I guess they just wanted to be safe, incase they ended up needing to insert another filler scene of a chase.
Actually, they could have done something interesting with that in the second episode. They could have come riding towards Winterfell being chased by hundreds of wights on exhausted horses at the end, thus giving us a reason for the sounding of the horns (instead of them just randomly sounding the horns for no conceivable reason, since only the audience can see the Others approaching) and maybe even giving the Dothraki a chance to show their quality by coming to their rescue. No? Oh right, if they did that, they couldn't have Tormund flirt with Brienne.Well, back on topic... I thought the scene with Jon and Danyeras frolicking on their dragons was seriously ridiculous. It's not like we're facing the end of the world. It's not like we have anything important to do. It's not like we're both known for being nobles who are supportive of the commoners. No, no, let's just go on a date while the small people cower in fear before the apocalypse incarnate. ugh. Not to mention that these creators claim that they can't do anything interesting because of CGI budget, but they have enough CGI budget to pencil in a dragon date. whatever. Does anybody believe Jon and Danyeras' relationship. I don't. They have zero chemistry. It's actually awkward. When Jon says ""Dany"", all huskily, my brain has an internal seizure from the sheer cringe.The forge scenes are useless. Seemingly, the only reason they exist is because the creative cast wanted an excuse to see a teenage girl undress and to show that they have no clue what obsidian actually is and don't care enough to do a 30 second google search to find out.I kinda liked the scene where Danyeras tells Sam she burned his family alive. It was well-done. I actually really dislike the character of Sam, but that is of course irrelevant. I enjoyed the acting and the successful follow-up of a plot thread. When he runs into the streets in despair, I thought it was really nice. But then he goes and talks to the robot and I lost interest. When he sees the mystical Bran and goes to him, it has some potential, but it seems inappropriate to mention Jon to him. After the news Sam received, his visit to the all-seeing Bran seems like it would have something to do with him.. but no, its ""hey dude, you're friends with that cool guy that's better than you, aren't you?""
He does do a decent job of informing Jon of his true parentage.. it is one of the better parts of the episode as well. Jon actually sounds like Jon in this scene.Okay, the last thing. Jamie's arrival. I really liked this scene, actually, for a few moments. When he comes riding in and you can only see a cloaked figure on horseback, it gave me a real Arthas Menethil vibe, and I was like, damn this is badass, they're going to have one of the Others or a turned character do some cool sabotage mission or some kind of magic or maybe assault the godswood in Winterfell.. then they reveal it to be Jamie. Okay, I was a little disappointed, but I still liked it. Jamie's arrival has the potential to be very interesting.Oh.. I forgot about the King's Landing scenes... Well, they were very forgettable. Cersei discusses the CGI budget with the Golden Company, then she calls herself a person who has paid sensual relations (apparently, profanity is not allowed in the reviews, sorry), has relations with a boring pirate, and pays an annoying mercenary who is not an assassin exorbitant funds to be an assassin. Whatever. It's yawn inducing to even try to remember it.In closing, I give this a 2/10. It was some cliche filler which relied on reminding people of the past for its success. High points included Sam's performance, Sansa's performance, Jon's performance in one particular scene, partially, and Jamie's arrival. If not for Sam's scene, I would probably go for a 1/10. Without Sansa, it would be a 0/10."
622," Best season premiere!
",10,True,"I had the honour of attending the first episode of the last season in Belfast. What an experience! You can clearly see that HBO has done everything in their power to make the season feel as grotesque as possible. The episode has everything a good Game of Thrones episode should contain: tension, shock, surprises, nudity and emotional moments. The episode is filled with beautiful and surprising reunions and feels much more cinematic. The pacing is fine and the fifty minutes feel like five minutes in the end. For me personally, this is the best season opener, closely followed by ""Two Swords"" and ""The North Remembers"". The episode also has an unexpected end, something to look forward to."
623," A disappointment
",6,False,There is something missing since George R.R Martin left the show. I thought they would fix it in season 8. But it's pretty clear now that David benioff and D.B Weiss chose the easy road and the profitable one. Game of thrones sadly has lost its unique charming and has become one of those T.V shows with those poorly made love stories. I felt like I'm watching one of those Disney movies.
624," Just Not Good.
",2,False,"I thought Season 7 all in all was a major step down from Seasons 1-6. The show had a shift from unpredictable, well-written, developed seasons in 1-6 into a rushed mess in 7. This episode kicks off Season 8 in the same fashion.Sadly, the only thing that surprises me on this show any more is how the writers continue to disrespect and dumb down many of the characters they (or GRRM) built for the first 5 or 6 seasons. Example 1: I know Bran is the Three Eyed Raven now, but really?? He's just being weird for no reason. He can know things AND have at least a trace of the same characteristics that he had in the other seasons. Instead he's this meloncholy stump that is not enjoyable to watch at all. He's only used as a device to reveal things that the show doesn't have time to spell out any more. Example 2: I have no clue why the writers have decided to make Sansa out to be someone she isn't. Arya literally says Sansa is the smartest person she's ever met. Sansa? I mean she isn't dumb by any means, but after watching the previous episodes, I would not give her the right to say ""you know I used to think you were the most clever man in Westeros."" To TYRION! Tyrion was an incredible ""game player"" in the early seasons. He's very smart. Now the show has reduced him, as they did to my guy Littlefinger, to someone he isn't. Getting dissed by Sansa...never thought I'd see it. I could go on and on about how every character on the show just seems to be acting out of character- and it's not their fault, it's the dialogue and plot written. People are doing things they just never would've done previously.Another thing I really disliked about this episode: the dragon scene with Jon and Dany. What was that? It was like something you'd see in some corny movie. That was not Game of Thrones material...(why did they even go flying anyways, they had just said how the dragons had barely been eating, and hated the North, why waste their little energy by flying further North?) the cheesy dialogue along with the dragon being behind them as a punchline made this feel like How to Train Your Dragon or a Disney film.Overall this episode was just corny, sloppy, and boring. I was hopeful they'd turn it around after all of Season 7's rushed mistakes and plot holes. Doesn't look like that will be happening, barring a miracle."
625," Average GoT episode with terrible dialogues
",7,False,This episode is just full of fillers and forced reunions. Felt like a Disney drama sequence.
626," Mediocre
",5,False,"Didn't particularly like it. Feels like there was a lot of unimportant plot stuffing, and moments that were supposed to be meaningful were tarnished by shallow and fan-servicey writing. Some rather bad humour in this episode as well that didn't really fit the tone."
627," Meh!
",4,False,"Game of Thrones is going down the drain. Admit it people. Weis and Benioff are taking A Song of Ice & Fire and literally butchering it.There is nothing in the current GoT that is on par with George R. R. Martin's impeccable and realistic storytelling that drove the series to its current heights between season 1 and 5. You just aren't invested in the happenings anymore. There is no element of deep intrigue that gets woven through seasons and episodes. Instead you have happenings that just happen.Happenings that don't stand on any concrete footing. There is no build up to them. Theon just drops in and gets a jump on Euron's crew while they are at sea and amongst the famed mercenaries of the Golden Company! And Sansa just becomes a scheming megalomaniac who is hell-bent on undermining Jon Snow! And yes, vicious dragons love to snort disapproval at kissing couples. (I forget, is it ""How To Train Your Dragon"" I am watching?)Furthermore, now there is no fear of the series yanking your favorite character away. You know they are going to survive against all odds (Snow wasn't going to fall off that flipping dragon despite that cheap plummet). Probably only dying during those Transformers-style, mid-season and penultimate episodes.During this premiere, I spent more time browsing Reddit on my phone than actually being captivated by anything happening on-screen. Things have gotten so banal that even the ""spice ups"" don't look appealing anymore.I miss the GoT that had me forgetting to take a sip from the drink in my hand. I miss GRRM's storytelling. I feel sad for the shallow, commercialized fodder this series has become."
628," Why the Rush? And when did It became a Disney show?
",3,False,"This episode at times felt very rushed. For instance, when Dany finds out that one of her dragons/children has been reanimated by the night king we don't see her reaction. Instead we cut right to the absolute worst scene of the entire show, the Tain your dragon scene.This was not GOT worthy and more like a Disney film. Why would Dany take Jon on a dragon Ride when only Targarians can ride dragons? She did not know Jon's heritage at that point."
629," Don't know what you guys expected...
",9,True,"Ok guys, I really don't understand what did you expect 'cause I see bunch of you disappointed or whatever-yeah, we waited for almost two long years for this season to come, but it's just the first episode.It's unrealistic if you meant that there is going to be war/death etc already-we had to see the arrival to Winterfell, reunions, some pieces coming back together like a puzzle-just the temperature is starting to grow. I mean, you saw the ending, long winter is here, that's it. ;)We still have 5 episodes, and I believe they're going to be great. :)All in all-it is a great opening for all the upcoming events."
630," Get the Damn White Walkers !!
",7,False,"Can't believe that there wasn't a single scene showing White Walkers. Did they just go to sleep or decide to chill after breaking down the Wall ? How did Tormund, Beric & the lot survive the pile of snow they would've been buried under ?Too many loopholes. Way too much focus on reunions.The only scenes I enjoyed were Dany-Jorah-Sam and then the Sam-Jon ones.Hopefully episode 2 onward, the episodes have drama, thrill and bloody WHITE WALKERS !!"
631," Meh...
",1,False,"Lazy writing, cheesy jokes, unemotional reunions and all round predictability. Everything I disliked about the latter stages of season 7 seems very prevalent in this episode, which has got me slightly worried. Feels more like a standard blockbuster than Game of Thrones recently. Really lacking any shock factor.Fingers crossed for the rest of the season."
632," Disappointment!
",1,False,"I've waited nearly 2 years for this !!!!!!!
At the middle of the episode i felt like I'm watching a lame Netflix show!!!!!"
633," A poor start
",5,False,"With only 6 episodes left and after how season 7 panned out (everything moving at triple speed) I'm shocked at how much of a non-event this episode was. How can they rush through a whole season only to slow everything back down to a snails pace at the start of the next. It's inexplicable.It could be forgiven in part if anything that happened was remotely fun to watch but it wasn't. Some of the scenes and dialogue between characters was plain awful and embarrassing. As others have pointed out it felt like watching a completely different show in parts.I don't have much hope left for a decent ending at this rate. They had a chance to bounce back from the decline which started in season 5 but they've blown it.Regardless of what happens in the remaining episodes, there's no forgiving the rubbish we've had to endure getting there."
634," Good opener
",8,True,"Season 8 is the most divisive in the whole history of GAME OF THRONES, but so far we're off to a good start with this opening episode. Generally it works well, although Arya's still oddly off and there's at least one childish and stupid interlude, the dragon flying sequence between Jon and Daenerys, which feels like it belongs in a Disney film - a shame that CGI budget didn't get added to episode three. Otherwise, this is well directed and entertaining, with lots of interesting meeting and dialogues between characters who haven't seen each other for years. A set-up episode, for sure, but one that works."
635," Not that good!!! And I love GOT!!!
",7,False,"The moment Jon rides a dragon for the first time should be epic, not comic!!! what a disappointment!!! What were they thinking!!! I have never before given a GOT episode less than 9!!! There is no inspiration anymore!!!"
636," GOT is history now. Funny episode as opposed to GOT standard.
",5,False,"Well TBH almost 80% of episode was just meh. All the characters are doing comedy, don't know if writers have forgotten the genre of GOT or what. It looks like all the characters are trying hard to be themsleves and failing. Bran told them that the wall is breached and night king is coming along with a dragon and dany shows no reaction and just boom rides the dragon with jon snow like nothing is serious. I don't know what the heck is going on just gave these 5 stars for coz we love GOT. 60 mins just for reunion? Writers are high or what?."
637," Plays it Safe
",1,False,"For the most part, this episode was predictable, and that includes the high points like Sam revealing Jon's true lineage and Jaime's encounter with Bran. We know both of these things would eventually happen - though Sam's acting was top notch. The jokes were funny, but there wasn't too much plot progression. As with season 7, this episode felt a bit rushed - how did Theon magically rescue his sister? What could have been a well-developed plot arch was rushed in a matter of minutes.That said, this was still an enjoyable episode, if not slightly bland by GOT's standards."
638," Why is the terrible writing accepted.
",1,False,"What made GOT stand out was not the CGI, the cinematography and the action scenes that any show can have, it was the amazing writing, the complicated plot and the mysterious characters. The show was made special and different by the last three but instead of taking the time and effort to keep the show special, they dulled it down and took the easy way to make money.The writing is not just mediocre, it's straight up abysmal at this point and the trend continues downwards every season. I thought that at the end of last season that they'd learn and have taken an extra year and have much more time to improve their writing, no, it turn out that they did the opposite and spent even less time making a convincing and immersive story. The mysterious characters with multiple intentions are just trashed and everyone is bucketed into 'good' and 'bad' with no depth to the characters.The first 3 seasons of the show is GOT for me. The rest is a rushed product. I don't know how anyone can write this bad, you could have given the pen to any true GOT fan and they would have created a much more compelling tale than this garbage."
639," Really the last good GoT episode
",9,True,Definitely the last good episode on the show. It's almost heartbreaking really.
640," Come on people!
",8,True,A knight of the seven kingdoms is not as half bad as other episode!! Don't drag it down with the others. Give some respect to the producers and writers of this episode please
641," Goodbye, friends
",10,True,Just an incredible penultimate episode. Every character had a moment. So much rich & incredible interaction. This is goodbye to a lot of characters tonight. It's devastating. Next weekend will be like a funeral. Im terrified. And not ready. Be careful what you wish for when you want non stop action. Ep 3 will be just that and everything you've loved about this show will turn to ash in your mouth. You'll want to come back to this episode after it all just to see their faces.
642," Michael Bay fans please leave!
",10,True,"I'm sorry but clearly some people on here have never properly watched the show or have just recently binged it all and just skipped past the ""boring"" talking bits?! Seriously GOTs has always been character driven, that's why when the big moments happen you feel so emotionally involved! Next weeks Episode 3 is a 1hour 22 minute battle sequence that has been set up perfectly by the first 2 episodes. Those of you leaving 1 star reviews need to get a grip and have a serious reality check! I'm not saying everyone should give this episode a 9 or 10 but anything below a 7 is madness. If you just want mindless action and fighting with no character driven storylines go and watch a Transformers movie!"
643," A great episode showing each character in what is potentially their last moments
",10,True,"To everyone saying that this episode is a boring filler episode, you need to understand that it is a lot of characters' final moments on the show. If you wanted the show to rush to the action and forget about any touching character moments then you're watching the wrong show. Every character had a different way of coping with the inevitable which made the episode brilliant and doesn't give away any clues on what characters will survive the battle. When game of thrones is over, this will be the saddest episode to look back on as we'll realise that it's the last time we'll see certain characters' traits and interactions with each other. 10/10Edit: Easily the best episode of the season."
644," One of the Best Episodes
",10,True,"Hands down, top 5 episode of the entire series. This is going to be the last time we see any of these character interactions with the Battle of Winterfell set to begin. Brienne being knighted was as emotional a moment as we've seen in this series. To see her finally get the recognition she deserves, from the man she desperately loves, was amazing. Jon's confession to Dany about his parentage was completely unexpected. And her reaction proves to Jon, and the audience, that all that matters to Dany is sitting upon the throne. She wasn't happy for Jon or that Jon now knows who he is and where he comes from. She only cared about herself and keeping 'her' thrown. Brienne standing up for Jamie, Jorah doing the same for Tyrion, Sansa showing what an incredible leader she has become. Trusting in Brienne and also negotiating with Dany and holding her own. To see Davos, Pod, Tormund, Tyrion, Jamie and Brienne in one room, drinking wine (and giants milk!) was something I never thought we'd get to see. Gathering all these diverse characters together was fantastic to see on screen. Also getting the Night Watch reunion and the Hound & Arya (maybe the last time) having a drink together. There was so much to this episode. 10/10"
645," Build-up for the most anticipated battle in tv history
",10,True,"Boy did this deliver. I liked the premiere 'Winterfell', but this is on an entirely different level. I laughed, I got chills, I cried. I won't spoil anything, but the writing in this is incredible. Even though I love Game of Thrones (also the later seasons), I never thought I'd say that about a season 8 episode. Sure, the writing last episode was good, but this is seriously season 3 - 4 levels of writing. Beats 'Kissed by Fire' as my favorite build-up episode. I think that when all is said and done and people rewatch the entire show, this will be one of the best episodes. It just flows so well and perfectly prepares us for the biggest battle we're ever going to see. I'm gonna miss Game of Thrones so much, let's enjoy it while it lasts."
646," This episode was for true fans!
",10,True,Anyone who has been watching this show for a decade knows the value of this episode. We never had an episode like this where almost the whole cast was in a single scene! This episode was really for the true fans of got who have been wishing to see how all these actors can come together and interact with each other. This episode was and emotional roller coaster where u laugh in one scene and cry in the next one! I loved it to the core!
647," It was awesome
",10,True,"Fun episode reminds me of the old game of thrones
It was really fun to watch especially the scene of Brienne of Tarth becoming what she always wanted to be and jaime
Thats was so heartwarming"
648," Towards War!
",8,True,It was a better episode than the first episode. It was a episode that prepared the viewer for battle. It gave us the signal of the next episode. I think we will finally see the battle of ice and fire in the next episode.It started with Jaime's court scene. Daenerys was more angry with Tyrion more than her hatred of Jaime. She became more angry with him for deceiving herself and showed Tyrion guilty. He was somehow pardoned by Brienne's defense of Jaime.Bran and Jaime finally met. It was one of the scenes I was expecting.Then we watched the scene of Daenerys and Sansa. Their speeches as if winning the battle were disturbing. They should have been more serious. I didn't like the reaction Daenerys showed when she found out that Jon was Targaryen.We've seen battle tactics. We're going to see if the war will begin in the next episode. Events can be estimated right now. I'm waiting for astonishing events in the next episodes. Waiting for the next episode with impatience. We're going to watch a longer episode than 1 hour. 8/10
649," Thrones delivers the character piece we've been waiting for in the calm before the storm - and it's beautiful.
",10,True,"I see complaints from people that this episode was boring, did nothing to further the plot, was just setup, etc. To me this is ridiculous - this episode is crucial if next week's is going to be as good as they're saying it will be. Next week is the spectacle, this week was the heart.GoT in its first few seasons often had episodes where most (or all) of the screentime would literally just be various characters talking with very little action, and that's what made the show. Because then when the characters die so brutally, it actually hurts, and our characters were real, flawed and complex people, changed by their experiences and relationships. It's what makes every scene of this saga so compelling to watch. And now there will be little or no more of this in Game Of Thrones; we have four eps left, one of which is the Battle Of Winterfell and one of which is the finale. We can assume that we're going to be seeing a hell of a lot of action over the next four weeks, so this episode was the last chance for our characters, who have all travelled to the farthest reaches of Westeros and Essos and all the way back, to do what is the only natural thing for them to do on the last night of their lives: sit and drink and talk. And it was goddam beautiful. It's thanks to this episode's time spent with characters that next week's episode is going to hurt so much, when we see some of them fall at the hands of the Night King and his army.So many beautiful moments came from this: Davos' heartbreak at seeing the strong little girl with grayscale and remembering his Princess; Theon finally coming home; the reunion of the Night's Watch brothers, all still with one mission in mind; Jorah showing his worth to Dany and receiving his own Valyrian steel sword for his service to Westeros; Pod's unwavering support to his mentors and good heart; Tyrion's self-doubt but honest loyalty (and love for wine); Arya and Gendry finally together on what could be their last night; Missandei and Grey Worm planning their life together; Arya, the Hound and Beric contemplating their fate; and finally pretty much any interaction Jaime had with another character, finally rounding off his redemptive arc in the most poetic of ways (Jaime and Brienne are golden in their scenes together) and paying off 8 years of character development, bad choices and a good heart. Everything here feels earned, natural and necessary. This may be the last episode we spend hearing many of the characters speak their hearts and minds, and to me it feels like the conclusion of many of GoT's greatest characters arcs and plots. It's not even fan service; it just feels right.I also have to give huge praise to the scene in the crypts with Jon and Dany at the end. Mirroring last week's scene down there brilliantly, with the camera now focussed on Dany as she hears the news (credit to Emilia Clarke there). Interesting that this scene came shortly before the battle and in the same episode that Dany admits she really does love Jon - it'll be interesting to see if this has any repercussions next week. Also this episode is hardly without excitement. The comedy is very well placed and made me laugh unusually hard for GoT (again, just so it hurts more when next week takes some of these guys from us), and the tension in Winterfell as Jaime arrives is tremendous. Furthermore, the way this thing builds and builds until the dead arrive on the rise beyond Winterfell, you can literally feel time ticking away as the characters accept their fate. It's haunting to watch, and I honestly believe that it'll all pay off in the most explosive, epic and painful way next week and in the weeks to come.This episode is not filler. It's not boring if you care about the characters. It's not simple. It's not even slow even though it never leaves Winterfell and all takes place in one day and night. It's perfect character drama and the calm before the storm. It's a beautiful conclusion to years of journies, ordeals, betrayals, heartbreak, wars, oaths and reunions. And if it weren't for this episode then next week would just be another Thrones battle - but this is the Battle Of Winterfell, and everything and everyone is at stake. This is probably Game Of Thrones' last great character piece and it's a joy to see such talent come together and pay off their years of hard work and incredible storytelling. We'll cry even more tears because of it."
650," One of the masterpieces of Game of Thrones
",10,True,"At first, we all expected for an episode like the first one of the season, with all the preparations for the great battle. But they give us an unexpected rush of feelings. As the dead march to Winterfell, we get a unique chance to see every main character with an open heart to express their feelings, their regrets, redemption, fears and hopes. I don't know if we are aware of how hard it's to reach that and transmit it to the audience in such a magnificent way. This goes beyond fights and sex, we got one last time to share with the persons we have been following for nearly ten years, in what it might be their last moments on screen. I'm sure this experience will be geting more credit after the Battle of Winterfell, and the show ending. For me, it's enough to say that we are beholding one of the masterpieces of the greatest show ever aired."
651," Ser Brienne of Tarth
",10,True,"I start watching Game of Thrones this spring so am just now watching season 8 (August 12). I have heard nothing good about this season. But people are wrong, at least for the first two episodes.
This episode was amazing!"
652," The best action-less episode of Game of Thrones!
",10,True,"This is an intelligent episode. Brilliant writing, directing, acting, cinematography. The main theme is memory. What and when to forgive, and what to remember. ""Never forget who you are!"" All characters remember who they were, and what they've become, before death arrives. It is also a farewell episode. We will lose them all this season. ""We never want them to leave"" but they all will. Valar Morgulis! But we will remember ! Fans will remember!"

",9,True,"This episode was amazing at setting the tone for the upcoming battle, tying off loose ends, and starting a final storylines."
654," Quiet reflections
",10,True,Rarely do we get to spend so much time with the characters before a large battle. And in this episode we got to visit with each of them and gain some understanding into who they are. We got some powerfully quiet scenes to remember why we cared for them and to feel the distress of the battle more intensely.
655," The only good episode of this season
",9,True,"This one felt like more authentic GoT compared to the rest of the eighth season. A lot of good story arcs are concluded and you definitely feel the growing tension leading up to the next episode. Podd's song was the highlight of the entire season, really capturing the sobering calm before the storm and giving us one final moment of happiness before the rest of the season went downhill fast."
656," Only real ""GoT"" episode in this dissappointing season
",10,True,"This was the only episode that matches the sheer quality of past seasons. It had good dialogues and scripts, and set the stage for the coming battle flawlessly. I was so excited and hyped and I had no doubt that this season is also going to be epic.
But Alas!!! That was not the case."
657," The Last Night
",10,True,"It's come to the point of this show where I can watch reunions and first meetings for hours and never get tired of it. I get it, the show has done 2 straight weeks of ""set up"", but it seems completely fitting to me. Even after all of the long-awaited reunions we got last week, we still needed some time to breathe with these characters for another week in Winterfell.First thing of note is that this episode was set entirely in Winterfell, no Iron Islands with Yara or King's Landing with Euron/Cersei. And to be honest, do we expect either setting to fit in next week either? If it's supposed to be an episode entirely on the battlefield, than there's no reason to show any other setting. It's safe to say they were not missed tonight.As expected, the episode began with Jaime in front of all the Lords, Kings, and Queens left in Winterfell as he ""atoned"" for his past sins. It wasn't all that shocking or surprising, we knew the people who would stand up for him (Tyrion & Brienne), the people who would not (Sansa & Daenerys) and the one in between (Bran), but it was nonetheless thrilling to watch. There were two lines that specifically stood out to me. The first being Brienne saying Jaime is a ""Man with honor"", which is a touching callback to the episode in season 2 titled ""A Man Without Honor"" in which she refers to Jaime as such. The second being Bran ending the conversation with ""The things we do for love"", talk about callbacks. I truly can't get enough of this.Jaime and Brienne had quite a week together (which really worries me for both of their fates in the coming weeks), with Jaime asking Brienne to serve under her in the battlefield, and then him knighting her later in the episode in what was one of the most touching scenes this show has ever given us. How nice was it to see Brienne smile a bit in that sequence? Of all the titles people receive in this show, making Brienne a knight is at the top of the list.Another quick but touching scene was seeing Theon return to Winterfell and pledge his sword to Sansa once more. I nearly teared up, not going to lie. I truly believe Alfie Allen is one of the best actors on this show, always showing so much emotion with little dialogue over the years. It didn't take much for his and Sophie Turner's reaction to him arriving to move me significantly in this moment. Of course, this comes directly after the ""make-up"" scene between Sansa and Dany, which was surely welcomed. But it wouldn't be Game of Thrones without those finally few seconds of Sansa asking about what will happen to the North once it's all over. How many times are people going to bring up ""afterwards"" without realizing that this show never gives us good happy endings/happy ""afterwards""!I loved seeing everyone surround the table and plan for the battle, and I also loved that it wasn't just Jon providing insight. It's an Avengers style lineup in this scene, and it was nice seeing everyone from Jaime, Sansa, Tormund, and Bran step up here. Which brings up the next point that we got an answer of sorts as to what the Night King wants, which is Bran. Is Bran's purpose only so that people knew of Jon's true lineage? Does he meet his end at the hands of the Night King in the next episode, thus eliminating the ""world's memory""? Is that why Jon told Dany in this episode (because he needed to do it while Bran was still alive)? So by wanting an ""endless night"" does he need to kill absolutely everyone? Or is he satisfied once he kills Bran? I'm sure that's not the case, but still, so many questions left to answer. Some other notes worth mentioning:-GHOST
-the baby is real??
-Tormund is the MVP
-Shocked Jon told Dany already
-Pod is a singer
-Arya got her weapon....in more than one way tonight...
-""And now our watch Begins""
-Davos & the people
-Theon will definitely die next week10/10"

",8,True,"""A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms"" is an important episode, with reconciliations of old enemies; realization of Brienne of Tarth, now a knight of the Seven Kingdoms and Arya Stark, now a woman; and discovery of Jon Snow that now knows who he is. The episode is also a preparation for the next one that may be the best episode of the whole series and certainly the farewell of several characters. Looking forward to become true. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms"""

662," AGAIN! DO NOT lsiten to those ""USELESS EPISODE"" reviews
",9,True,"Same as the last episode, explosion nerds go out calling this episode useless and slow, attacking the producers as if they are wasting time and giving them useless filler episodes.
If that is what you got from these 2 episodes then you should seriously consider yourself stupid, like actually stupid.
Let me clear this out. The next 5 HOURS... yes 5 HOURS of the show that are left are gonna be probably one of the most action packed and full of tension hours in television history. I could have watched episodes like this last one for hours.
AMAZING interactions and dialogue. Seeing buddies laughing before their probable imminent death is just heart warming, with a little bit of tension thrown in there for Game of Thrones sake.
A list of amazing, possibly last happy moments, scenes:
*Theon reuniting with Sansa
*Arya and Gendry
*Brienne of Tarth fullfilling her childhood dream at the hand of Jaime whose arch is something incredible, possibly one of the best in television history
*The whole ""hangout"" near the fire.
*
It all seemed so genuine and just warmed my heart seeing that. Lots of humour, tension and a great build-up for the storm that is coming. THIS SHOW HAS ALWAYS BEEN CHARACTER INTERACTION DRIVEN. Just stop acting like this is a bad thing now as if the show is changed."
663," A really great episode
",10,True,A really great episode showing lots of emotions between the characters
664," More I think about it, the less I'm enjoying it
",6,False,"Immediately after watching this episode, I thought it was amazing. It kept you on the edge of your seat for the whole episode. I loved that Arya was the one to kill the Night King, especially after they usually leave all the 'hero' stuff to Jon and it makes the most sense considering her training. But then it sinks in that nearly 70 episodes of build up has lead to that. We learnt nothing about the Night King and his motive leaving us to be believe that he's just another stereotypical random bad guy who wants to destroy the world for no real reason. The Night King and his army have been teased as the biggest threat for the whole series just to be killed like that and ultimately serve no purpose for the entire series. I'm hoping something happens in the coming episodes that changes this and shows that they were more significant than they seem to be but it doesn't look like that will happen.Another issue is the plot armour that all the main characters had. It seemed as if all the significant characters besides Theon and Jorah (whose death everyone saw coming) were invincible. There were numerous times that characters were completely surrounded by wights and should have been easily killed just to be unexplainably saved. There is now way that Brienne, Jamie and Pod could have survived the wights being backed up against the wall like that no matter how good a swordsman they are. There's no way that Jon would have survived after the Night King raised the wights around him and having Dany save him at the last second was a cliche that the show has generally avoided up to this point.If they were going to kill off the Night King in this episode, it would have been much better if it was in combat against Jon, have the Night King beat Jon and then have Arya come in, save Jon and kill the Night King. They've been teasing a fight between Jon and the Night King for years which amounted to nothing.I still don't understand what the point of Bran is. Again, I'm hoping something happens in the coming episodes to explain why he did literally nothing. At this point, it seems as if he just warged into some ravens to watch the battle for a bit so I'm hoping that there was more to it than that. His character has just been annoying to watch since the end of season 4.The battle plan also seemed pretty stupid. Why send the Dothraki into slaughter like that? It was obviously not going to achieve anything and just wasted thousands of good fighters. It was cool to see all the flaming swords die out to show the size of the army though. But that again raises the question of how did so many characters survive being surrounded by wights when they were able to immediately slaughter the Dothraki? Jon was also basically useless. Why does he need to be on the dragon when they're fighting? The dragons been fighting for Dany for years so why does she now need Jon as a pilot? He would have been much more useful if he was in the fighting. Also, I know this is besides the point but how could anyone possibly hold onto a dragon flying that fast? You would be thrown off in seconds if it were realistic. What was trying to achieve at the end when he literally just yelled at a wight dragon?The episode wasn't all bad though, the action scenes were amazing even if it was too dark. Arya's journey was awesome to watch and it was amazing to see the pay off for all her training. Her scenes with Beric, the Hound and Mellisandre were amazing. Lyanna had the perfect death for her character, as did Theon and Jorah. Seeing Theon's arc come full circle was a very satisfying payoff. The acting was as good as always and I still thoroughly enjoyed watching it.I think that the people complaining about Arya killing the Night King seem to be forgetting or ignoring that she's had years of training and can move silently in complete darkness which is how she was able to get to the Night King in the first place.This episode could be improved if the next few episodes explain some of the biggest issues I have but currently it's hard to give it any more than 6.+ Arya killing the Night King instead of Jon or someone else
+ Basically anything to do with Arya was awesome
+ Theon's arc
+ Perfect end for Theon, Jorah and LyannaSo many unanswered questions about the Night King - main question being what was the point?Lighting was too darkPlot armour saved too many significant characters/ unrealistic survivalsWhat's the point of Bran?Apparent lack of battle planJon was basically useless"
665," VERY cool
",1,False,"Such an amazing episode! I love how the series has developed over the last 8 years. The earlier seasons were a little bit shaky in terms of what we, as an audience want to see. They focussed too much on clever, well-written dialogue, interesting character development and a well thought through plot. Since season 4 however, the writers have realised that what we REALLY want is shallow action sequences, poorly written one-liners, and characters being epic badasses in situations where anyone who isn't a main character would have definitely died (hello..?! superhero movies are popular for a reason!) Here are a few things which made this episode VERY cool:1) I loved the way that the cinematography cleverly reflected the theme of the villain. He's the NIGHT King. The way that they not only filmed everything at NIGHT but also bravely refused to use any competent lighting really improved my viewing experience. The fact that I had to strain my eyes to figure out what was going on for most of the episode really added to my immersion. I felt like I was actually there, bewildered in the darkness. Not only that, but the excessive use of 'shaky cam' and quick cuts made me feel like I too was being physically assaulted! (Didn't actually get hurt at all though. Clearly I'm a main character too! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!)2) The writers of this episode cleverly realised that having the characters make sensible, realistic decisions is nowhere near as important as seeing cool stuff happen! Having the Dothraki cavalry inexplicably charge blindly into the enemy is something which, in the earlier seasons would never have been thought of. Rob stark, Stannis Baratheon and Tywin Lannister were all bogged down in being true to their character and using actual tactics (BOOOOOORING!) All the flaming swords disappearing into the night was so epic, and seeing the whole army standing OUTSIDE the castle with the trebuchets as the front line was a super cool visual!3) The editing was incredible! The way that the main characters would be surrounded by enemies with absolutely no realistic way of surviving, only for the camera to cut away and for them to be fine 5 minutes later was so clever. This happened roughly 3 times for EVERY major character, and every time I was on the edge of my seat. Such a brilliant way of manufacturing meaningless and unsatisfying tension! In the earlier seasons the main characters were just like anybody else. It felt like they were actually in danger when the action started which I really didn't like. They're supposed to be epic, badass heroes guys! Come on!4) The resolution of the white walker narrative could not have been more BRILLIANT! 7 and a half seasons of build-up, Jon Snow engaged in a constant struggle against the Night King and the army of the dead (even dying and being resurrected in the process) the idea that all the petty squabbling for the iron throne is trivial when compared to the real threat; the personification of death itself... all resolved by Arya stabbing him in the tummy! Such genius writing! Arya is such a badass little ninja! YAAAAS QUEEN! It subverted all of our expectations in such a satisfying way! In the earlier seasons shocking things happened as well but they were always foreshadowed, they involved characters who actually had an investment in the particular plot-line, and they had a strong emotional impact. These are all unimportant ideas. When Arya jumped past literally hundreds of enemies out of nowhere like an actual superhero (Marvel/GoT crossover episode yes please! I can only dream!!) and resolved a 7 season long plot-line which she had nothing to do with, it was so badass! She literally only found out the white walkers existed a few episodes ago! Nobody could possibly see it coming! Such genius writing! Some people seem to think that Jon Snow should have had some input, but it's way more expectation subverty if he doesn't. I love that his whole purpose as a character was taken care of without him in such an unsatisfying way, and I love that he didn't die or anything to give any kind of closure or emotional impact. I also love that bran did literally nothing other than act as bait even though hours upon hours of showtime was dedicated to the three eyed raven plot (LOL Jojen and Hodor why'd you bother dying for him you numpties!) I also love that the white walkers didn't end up having any interesting backstory or motivations and that they were literally one dimensional cartoon bad-guys who just want to kill everyone because that's what they do. Most of all I really love that we have such an emotionally engaging conflict now with the middle-aged alcoholic and her pirate boy-toy over who gets to sit on the pointy chair oregfihaweporgihWEOIGHVOWIHGERRWHGVOAIHG!!Art is dead and everyone seems to love it"

668," I saw this coming ever since Season 7.
",1,False,"Applause for the cast and crew. Fantastic job to them. Such a shame their incredible effort is literally annihilated by the absolute disgrace of mediocrity they call writing.I honestly saw this coming ever since that episode in season 7, when Jon and Co. are surrounded by an army of wights only to have Danny do the clichee swoop in save. But hey, at least she lost a dragon, which enabled NK to bring down the wall. So it came at a big cost. And even SO, it still left a horrid taste. That's just not the kind of thing you expect from GoT. There are no clichee swoopsaves. People don't have plot armour. And not having plot armour is exactly why Jon's bringing back to life was so mysterious and interesting. That just does not happen in GoT, so why did it?Well, it apparently happened so that he could yell at an undead dragon. That, and be generally useless in every other aspect of the final battle. I just don't get it. He basically orchestrated this alliance, only to aimlessly wonder around on a dragon for half the episode, time during which his army is getting decimated.Not to mention he again gets clichee saved by Danny, while again surrounded by an entire army of wights.
I'd be ok with this, if she then just flew off. But no, the writers are absolutely keen in insulting the masterpiece this show used to be and ALL IT'S AUDIENCE. For some very cheap drama points, dragon gets overwhelmed by wights and she falls off. Now she's surrounded by an army of wights.I'd be ok with this, if she at this point gets killed. I love her character, although I feel sub-par writing is slowly turning her into a tyrant for no real apparent reason. But she doesn't die, because it's her turn to strap on some Legendary Plot Armor and get clichee saved by none other than Lord Friendzone himself.I'm not even going to address how he even managed to find her, let alone get to her.
Had Danny died just in time for him to see it, yet be unable to help, that's the GoT we know. Had he also died now because he tried to save her, got there too late, and now found himself surrounded too, that's the GoT we know.
Not this.I'm not keen on seeing them die. But if you're going to put them in situations where they should die, then they need to die. But hey, 7 seasons in plot armor becomes a thing, so to hell with everything this show used to stand for, right?Need I even mention battle tactics?This is the biggest battle we've ever known. We have dragons and a castle. You know, that thing with big walls? yeah, that. So what do we do? Not fortify them. At all. The dead literally climb the walls at some point, because NOTHING was done to counter that. They have 0 defenses. No one thought some oil cauldrons would be useful to rain some fire down on climbers. I mean fire is only their biggest weakness, easy to forget after all.
No one thought to spike the walls up with some dragonglass shards? Could that maybe be useful?
Ofcourse not. Nevermind such nonesense. Lets instead roll our siege engines out to the, you guessed it, front lines. Ballistas, and you place them just in front of your Unsullied formations. I guess it shouldn't come as a surprise that the writers believe spears have a longer effective range than what are virtually artillery units. Christ...Not to mention the outer fortifications. They had like one ditch, 5 feet from the castle walls no less, and some wooden spikes. Against the greatest threat the world has ever known. 10/10. A God damn sand castle build by an 8 year old is more defensible.And the Dothraki. Oh dear God the Dothraki. I'm gonna give them points for the epic scenery though. Flaming swords were cool and the way they all get extinguished is bonechilling at least. Really got me on edge there, but that's simply because I wasn't expecting them ALL TO DIE for NO REASON. Cavalry skirmishes are a thing, and I honestly believed they'd be doing some sort of recon run by since the visibility wasn't that great. Nope. They just charge in and die. Who gives that order? You have MOUNTED shock troopers that can literally trample undead hordes and relieve pressure from ANY flank due to their exceptional mobility. You're also hopelessly outnumbered. You have no battle field visibility. So what do you do? Send them all to die. Why? Because it looks cool. That's GoT now.Bran is useless. Wargs into some ravens to do nothing in particular. Then sits there for the rest of the battle, doing nothing in particular. Tells Theon he'll die, while continuing to do nothing in particular. Then NK gets gutted by Arya when she superhero jumps in, not two seconds later, time during which Bran does, you guessed it, nothing in particular.Theon's redemption arc was cool. But he didn't die defending Bran. He basically speared himself into the NK. You wanna know who went out like a beast? Berric Dondarrion.
Theon could very well had not moved a single muscle for like 5 more moments and he'd still be breathing.You know what's the worst part? I'd be ok with her being hyper sneaky and getting the jump on NK like that. She's had years of assassin training, so sure, why not. But if you're trying to sell that point, DON'T SHOW HER FAILING AT IT JUST MOMENTS BEFORE. For the love of God she almost died trying to sneak though a damn library not 15 minutes prior.NK is a disgrace. One of the most disappointing villains in the history of fiction. And that's purely by virtue of wasted potential. He was SO cool. Dude can one shot a damn dragon. All the mystery around him. Presumably EONS of battle experience and he never swings his sword once. Not ONCE, in 8 seasons. And worse still, doesn't even go out in a fight.Every major character should have died. Every. Single. One. Because the writers put all of them in situations were death was inevitable. Why? to ""subvert expectations"" and create cheap emotional thrills.Such a disgrace. Such a waste. And I'm supposed to care about what happens with Cersei now? Phhbt.Imagine if Lord of the Rings killed off Sauron and then were like ""Woah woah, hold up. There's still Saruman to worry about"".
Jesus Christ.Ladies and gentleman, that's GoT now."

",5,False,"Firstly, massive credit to the music composer for this episode, the music was absolutely perfect, but that was about it.
The visuals were great! But only on second viewing when having playback in 4k whilst also having the brightness on maximum, nobody could see what was going on at all throughout the episode if it wasn't in 4k quality, which is a horrible experience.
The writing was as if they got a 9 year old with no knowledge of game of thrones to write it, the army tactics were absolutely tragic and the amount of plot armour is actually unreal, screw the final battle against Cercie, just let Jon Snow run at the Lannister army all on his own, his plot armour will save him.Summarising, this was a gigantic middle finger to every single fan."

Imagine Game of Thrones if Rob Stark smelled something was fishy at his wedding. How did it come to this?The apotheosis of failure, the triumph of stupidity, plot-armor and cliches, all this and more is this shameful, ridiculous, cretinous excuse for an ""epic"" finale.When the episode begins, Melissandre appears, casts flaming sword on all the Dothraki, who, for no reason, then charge at the army of the dead and die.All? NO! The only character with a name, Jorah, rides back, because this is the show you are watching nowadays.After the dead attack and half the army is dead, Daenerys and Jon remember they have dragons, burn a few wights, then get distracted trying to reach the night king. The dead invade winterfell, while some important characters mysteriously wander the halls. Meanwhile, Bran Stark, who is supposed to be bait, is waiting, warging into some ravens, for ABSOLUTELY NO REASON. A few secondary characters die, the defenders (who were told to man the walls only when the dead breached the trench) somehow beat them back (albeit temporarily).Now, the whole thing is very Helm's Deep, only worse (everyone is outside the walls for some unfathomable reason), but then we get to the final, unforgivable drivel that shames all of mankind. Dany burns the Night King with all her dragon's fire, but the guy doesn't even blink, then snaps his fingers and all the dead rise back. Dramatic music plays, as the whole episode drifts into slow motion and ""despair"" takes over. How are the good guys going to win? Theon, who was the only one sure to die, kills every last wight around Bran (he's still watching TV in his head) and then is told ""goodbye"", so he charges at the approaching night king and is killed. Meanwhile, Jon Snow, who has been wandering aimlessly throughout the whole episode, doing nothing of importance, is about to get killed by the undead dragon. BUT WAIT. Despite the fact that there are about 300 more wights and white walkers in the Godswood with the Night King, SUDDENLY a flying Arya comes and...stabs the night king, who now dies.In the end, Melissandre walks away and kills herself for no reason other than that she said she'd die and had no more role to play.All in all, more people died in the Red Wedding than in the ""ultimate"" battle against the army of the dead. This is GoT now. No one dies. Nothing makes sense. All is stupid.If you liked this disgusting piece of dragon-poop, I don't want to know you. I genuinely dislike you."

And most of the individual story lines building up to this episode, fell flat.The scenery is dark and there is very little visibility over the battle. For those interested in battle tactics and a step by step defense, there isn't any.
The army of the dead attacks, their number advantage makes them invincible, and move in an illogical tidal wave formation that cant be stopped.
Only until the lord of light steps in and lits a trench on fire that delays the attack a few minutes.John Snow flies around on a dragon and doesnt do anything important.
Bran uses his far seer magic to control a few crows into observing the night king up close. He literally doesnt do anything more than that.
When all is lost and every story character is a second away from death, Arya Stark jumps out from nowhere and stabs the night king. Causing the entire army including all the white-walkers to die instantly.There were no story revelations whatsoever."

No epic battles, no sacrifices, no impactful casualties, no hard decisions. White Walkers were brushed aside with ease in just one episode. Winter came and winter went - just like that.By the time I'm writing this, almost 70 000 people have given this episode a perfect 10. Let that sink in - 70 000.

There is a 700ft wall of ice that has stood for thousands of years to keep the others out. Knowing how it all ends just makes me burst into laughter. It was all a complete joke, all for nothing. Thousands of years of people being sent to guard the wall for the Night's Watch, and the Night King could have been defeated in literally one evening, how hilariously stupid.This show is now a meme, and nothing more."

683," Say thank you to the mediocre writing.
",7,False,"I've never written a review for a GoT episode, but I had to for this.
The only reason I'm giving this a 7/10 is due to the monumental amount of effort the cast and crew invested into the making of this episode. The set designs, the production value, the CGI, the mammoth battle sequences, and the acting of the cast members. I can only imagine how tiring it was for the cast and crew during those 55 long days and nights. I applaud their perseverance.
Yet, the entire time I watched this episode, not for a minute could I stop and appreciate their efforts. The writing was just that mediocre.
The main characters were shrouded with layers upon layers of plot armour. Jamie and Podrick are backed into a corner by an army of the undead yet somehow fend them off. Tyrion, Sansa, Varys, and Gilly are trapped in the crypts with the undead yet somehow survive with only two daggers. Jon Snow gets surrounded by the undead but manages to fight them off long enough for Dany to save him. I could keep going on.
The writers took the realism aspect that GoT is infamous for and tossed it in the rubbish bin. You hype up the Long Night for 8 seasons and paint the White Walkers as the supreme supernatural threat of the series only for them to be defeated in one episode without any casualty from the main characters.
There were a few noticeable continuity mistakes between the transition of scenes, but those can be forgiven. You take on the huge task that was this battle sequence, there's bound to be some mistakes.
The script, however, can not be forgiven. Hardhome was on a smaller scale yet I consider it leagues above this episode. It's a shame. Let's hope the last three episodes can make up for this."

Just fanboy kids who never understood what was the all tv show about. Plot armors, teleports, stupid storytelling, characters uselessness... things could never be approved by GRRM!"
689," Lore Breaking and Ignores Source Material
",2,False,"I expected a cleaner script than Season 7 since they took a longer break this season but I was wrong. This episode alone has many issues some being:* Lore breaking ""Scorpions"". A dragon's hide is extremely strong and can not get penetrated but the scorpion goes through Rhaegal's neck. The only other dragon to die to a scorpion attack in GoT/ASOIAF history was shot in the eye damaging the brain. The author describes this as a ""one in a million shot"".* Euron being a plot device to weaken Daenerys' forces. In Season 7 he is randomly teleported attacking the Greyjoy(Yara) and Dorne fleet and the Targaryen Unsullied fleet. This episode Dany's remaining fleet was destroyed and all of these attacks have been cheap and unsatisfying. Unless Dany has a traitor leaking her strategies this is just too much.* Conveniently killing off Rhaegal so Jon does not have to participate in the attack on King's Landing using dragonfire so he can keep his cookie cutter good personality. There was a perfect chance to kill off Rhaegal in Episode 3 but instead he was killed off as a failed shocking moment with no respect to the universe lore.* It is impossible for an airforce to be surprised by an ocean attack. Look at history, it has never happened. The writers excuse this as ""Dany forgetting Euron but Euron not forgetting about her"" when she has travelled to Dragonstone to prepare attacjs on her enemies, Euron and his fleet and Golden Company being over half of those enemies she plans to attack.* Forced Daenerys madness plot. This will probably happen in the books as well except there will be build up for it. Suddenly worrying about innocents when the Starks, Lannisters never had to ever worry about them is forced. The Starks took Winterfell back and surely innocents were murdered but since it is the Starks no one mentions it. The show had perfect opportunities to build up Dany's madness but every time it showed a controversial Dany scene it gave us another 10 just and moral scenes to delete it. Here you have Dany's arc about to reduced to Cersei's in two episodes instead of a slow and consistent descend to madness.* The direwolves are an extreme part of the characterisation of the Starks in the books but the show has not used them for anything. Ghost who is the last name Jon says before he dies in the books is given away in such an unsatisfying way. Why even have Ghost fight in Episode 3 if his teeth and paws will do nothing to the Others? As far as I am aware his teeth are not Dragonglass or Valyrian Steel. All Jon has done to Ghost this season is let him lose an ear and get serious injuries for nothing then abandons him.* Sansa's smartness is told by other characters but never shown. Given that in a deleted scene in Season 7 Sansa was about to execute Arya it is clear she is not smart as she or Arya claim. Sansa also risked the life of all the North by treating the Targaryens with disgust, without them the North would be doomed and a smart political player would shut their mouth and swallow their pride until the threat is over. Stop telling us Sansa is smart and instead show us that she is smart.* Varys complaining that Daenerys is cruel and never listens. Don't tell us she has been cruel and not listening, show us. Ever since Tyrion and Varys joined Dany as advisors she has listened to them in every single situation except the burning of the Tarlys. If she listen to Olenna, Elaria and Yara she would be sitting on the throne by now.* Bran is completely useless. He participated nothing in the ""Long"" Night surprisingly so you'd think he would have his own story here but nope. Fails to even take a look at Cersei and Euron.* This whole starve King's Landing strategy is also cruel but is being presented as a moral alternative. When cities are starved the people become violent and turn on each other, King's Landing has a population of one million which would be extremely destructive.* Inconsistent lines such as ""Gendry Rivers"", Tyrion being impressed with Bran's wheelchair although Doran Martell sits in one, incorrect ways of deaths for Jaime's line about the murder of his cousin and the Karstark he has killed.* Cersei does not take over Dragonstone which is extremely close to King's Landing. Additionally, Cersei does not attack Daenerys with her lore breaking scorpions when she comes to Missandei's parley.* Viserion's corpse just disappears. His body did not shatter like the White Walkers. Lyanna and Ed were turned into wights and their bodies did not decompose meaning Viserion wouldn't have either.* Davos does not sail with Dany's fleet when he is a skilled sailor. Dragonstone is an island so these armies will need to sail there and now that they have no fleet they are stranded on land near King's Landing.The writers clearly are just following the bullet points Geroge has provided without trying to build up and make a story around them. What this causes is an inconsistent plot with events being force and lorebreaking (such as the death of Rhaegal). Build up for major characters events such as Daenery's madness was put on pause until the Others are defeated then rushed after their death making the flow of events a complete failure."
690," Massive Budget, Massive Wait, Massive Letdown

691," I'm not mad, just disappointed
",4,False,"This episode had some decent moments. Good opening scene, funny banter between Tyrion/Jaime/Brienne, and we finally got some more Tyrion POV that has been lacking in the past couple of seasons. I also really liked that we got to see Dany being vulnerable from her point of view. The Jon/Dany scene was a standout this episode. We saw her conflicted and emotional, telling Jon how much he means to her, but also her being selfish and wanting him to keep quiet about his identity. Good setup, hopefully they don't butcher this in the final episodes.Really where this episode starts to fall apart is in the logistics of the big moments. The same thing that has been plaguing the show the past couple of years, and D&D don't disappoint us here.How does a naval fleet ambush a dragon? How? Seriously.
How does Dany not see them? I guess they were hiding behind that rock the entire time. But still were able to easily put three bolts into Rhaegal without him being able to fly away. Hmm, okay. So Euron has a vicious fleet with pinpoint accuracy and is about to wipe them out. Their ships are getting obliterated, Tyrion jumps ship, and then .... they make it to the shore. Wait, what?? What happened to the attack? I guess Euron got his prize possession Missandei and was like ""yep, we're good here, just let them run away.""So they get away, after losing a dragon to one of those giant crossbows super easily. They set up a meeting with Cersei, who is waiting with like 10 crossbow bolt things. And Drogon is just sitting there casually with them and 50 soldiers. WTF!? Are they braindead? You just saw your dragon die to these things, and you bring your other dragon here and just sit there?And the best part is Cersei doesn't even attack them! Why TF would Cersei not just win the war here? She is not above using wildfire to blow up thousands of people but doesn't want to kill her biggest threat sitting in front of her like a sitting duck. jesusI really want to enjoy this show, I really do. And if it was just one episode I might be able to suspend my belief. But this nonsensical stuff is just thrown at us again and again, and it really takes me out of the moment.Help, I just want to enjoy my favorite show :("

Literally the next episode we see battleplan scene where we find out that nope, half of the Unsullied is alive and half of The Dothraki is alive. Nice trolling, David. Next we are getting an exciting scene with Sansa, Arya, Bran finally finding out truth about Jon and soon as Bran starts to unveil the truth and all of us starts leaping forward to our tvs and monitors with excitement. Cut. Just like that. Later we see Sansa and Tyrion and excitement and tension building up again, we are about to see Tyrion's reaction about Jon being Targaryen. Can't wait for... Cut. Nice trolling, David, you had me there again. And then it just goes in a complete jokefest when Daenerys loses her second dragon and i will even ignore how she managed to not see the Iron Fleet from the sky, even a child can understand its not possible. Turns out she totally forgot about The Iron Fleet! Yes, guys. David Benioff in the next ""inside episode"" literally says, quoting again: ""While Dany kind of forgot about the Iron fleet and Euron's forces, they certainly haven't forgot about her"". When AGAIN in the same battleplan scene Varys says to Dany: ""And the Golden Company arrives in Kings Landing courtesy of Greyjoy fleet"" and we see Dany's unease reaction to this information. Again, nice trolling, David, you had me for the third time now. And then as a final two nails in the coffin we see Kings Landing suddenly changing from being fully surrouned by forest and water to becoming a city in a desert with no trees around and Daenerys after losing her second dragon decides to go and start NEGOTIATING(?!) just minutes after getting attacked, but not only that, negotiating in front of a woman who literally blew up a church full of people, who we all know will never negotiate with anyone, Daenerys decides it will be wise to stand in front of looked like 10-15 scorpions facing her and only ~50 unsullied protecting her and Drogon sitting in the background withing reach of all the scorpions. So just picture this. Two sides are at war and one side decides to ambush another side, so what the defending side will do in this situation? Go and negotiate. Yes, this is exactly how every conflict in the world works, just ignore what your enemy did to you minutes before and act like it didn't happen. Again, i am a fool who got trolled once more.

Why go there anyway? Just send ninjagirl to get rid of Cersei.The sea ""battle"" with Euron Greyjoy was... what was that? What happened? They did not show the events during the battle. It was so rushed felt like a filler.Jaime sudden switching personalities was odd.

I've tried to excuse it for the last couple of episodes, but this is not the Game of Thrones that I've loved for the longest time. I thought Game of Thrones was better than choosing shock-factor over actual storytelling, but I was wrong. I truly hope others can enjoy the new direction the show is taking, and if you do, then you are extremely lucky and I hope it lives up to your expectations. Sadly, however, I am not one of them. I'm sorry this is how it is ending, GRRM, because I don't think this is what you'd have wanted."

Sansa breaks a promise made to Jon not two minutes after swearing to him to uphold it. What? Arya says we have to stay together as a family and then rides off saying she will never return. Jon bids goodbye to his injured and faithful direwolf Ghost with no embrace or sentiment whatsoever. The jump shock scene in which Rhaegal is killed after all those years in such senseless and non-productive manner sent me over the edge. Dany descends into madness, emotionally outcast, alone. What? The final sequence in front of King's Landing makes no sense at all. They could have been overrun right them and there. And Tyrion pleads yet again to Cersei after he knows that Bronn was sent by her to kill him? Doesn't anyone review the scripts for basic logical consistency?

I guess for shock value and visuals, they had to die but now we need them so that's ok I guess. There's no logic behind the scenes, giant scorpions have 100% accuracy, characters are blind and writers and stupid and not in control of their own material.Or they simply do not care any more because they've been paid already and they are already moved on to ruin Star Wars futher.7 seasons, 8 years of build up in the most intricate and interesting series ever shown on TV and THIS is what we are getting?
Who approved this?
Why?"
700," Did HBO Honestly Believe People Would Like This???
",1,False,"Game of Thrones has suffered a STUNNING NOSEDIVE in quality this season! This episode was utterly absurd!!
*When Dany was joyriding her dragons over the enemy, did she forget she was at war?
*How could she POSSIBLY not see the big fleet of warships from the sky, when they could obviously see her?
*The scorpions were IMPOSSIBLY ACCURATE when the writers wanted them to be, then moments later, IMPOSSIBLY INACCURATE!
*Dany could EASILY have circled back and destroyed that fleet after it fired on her, since the guns clearly only pointed in ONE DIRECTION. But No! ???
*Cersei could EASILY have killed Dany, her queensguard, and her last remaining dragon as they stood TOTALLY EXPOSED beneath battlements lined with scorpions. But Cersei decides not to do so for NO REASON!I could go on and on, but you get the point. This show has, amazingly, gone from one of the greatest shows ever to truly cringe-worthy, fan fic, ""gone Hollywood"" absurdism. WOW!!"
701," Sad
",3,False,I don't want to rant or complain about this episode or series. I just wanted a good end to a great show. It's honestly heartbreaking to see this show end with such mediocrity.
702," Guess GoT means Game of Teleportation now.
",1,False,"Where to even start.I honestly cringe every time Danny portrays some of her newly acquired tyrant traits. I just don't understand. Why? Nothing in her character arc justifies it.
You know what does though? bad writing.Party scene was meh yet somewhat enjoyable thanks to Tormund mainly. Last episode was terrible and probably the biggest disappointment in TV history, but this episode was the first time I ever felt as if I was watching a cheap soap opera while viewing GoT. It's play-by-play Hollywood mediocrity.
> Step 1. Achieve important victory.
> Step 2. Remember Danny has a dark side, aaaand Immediately create artificial drama because people like Jon.
It's laughable. It's the definition of bad. it is a pure insult.You let the reveal between Jon, Bran, Sansa and Arya happen offscreen. What more do people need to understand what this show has become? That is what you do when you're incapable of coming up with something that's not trash for a change. Because it's the kind of scenario that requires some actual, good writing. You can't very well kill a dragon (or an entire Dothraki army) in every shot, can you? You can't. So just cut it. This would have NEVER happened in the first seasons. This WAS an important conversation. This NEEDED to be SEEN.
Good thing they swore secrecy though. Took Sansa a good 5 minutes or so to break.Jon barely looks at Ghost. The Direwolf. That's barely bigger than a sheep. There's so much wasted potential there. Nothing compared to the King of wasted potential himself. Or was it Night King? Can't seem to remember, BECAUSE HE WAS GONE IN 50 OR SO MINUTES!Then there's the ambush. If you think about the realism of that scenario you'll probably suffer a brain aneurysm.
If Danny has access to Starbucks, the Ironborn must have access to some serious radar tech. Unless anyone else knows how they pinpointed the Allied Fleet's location?If a large group of ships can see you, you can see them. But let's ignore that.Those Scorpions are cool. Except that's class of weapon doesn't work like that. It is not a sniper rifle. It is not accurate. At all.First two shots are lasers. The next 15 or so miss. Why? Because it's convenient. That, or Raegal forgot his plot armor at home. Poor thing.The writers are stupid, therefore Danny needs to be stupid too. All shots missed. All their weapons are mounted on the front. Do you:a) circle around and burn them to a crisp
or
b) retreatWhy the hell did Tormund not end up with Brianne? I honestly believed the sentiment between her and Jaime always has been a bond of respect and admiration. Ah but what kind of soap opera would this be if they didn't ruin that one too.Missandei gets teleported to Kings Landing. Yes, they've never seen her before, and yes, they know who she is. Shut up.
Everyone else gets GoTeleported to shore. Which, you know, adds more insult to injury. If they were that close to enemy territory, why the hell is Danny flying in open sight?I was mad before. I'm just disappointed now. Season 8 to Game of Thrones is what Mass Effect: Andromeda was to Mass Effect. A testament that any creation, not matter how loved, can be defiled and desecrated by the incompetence of the few, who for some god awful, unknown reason, call themselves writers.I can only hope George R. R. Martin doesn't watch this season. He'd probably die of a bad heart if he did."
703," I feel sorry for GRRM
",1,False,"This garbage could not be further from the GoT that GRRM created.
Congratulations D&D for destroying one of the best shows ever! Please tell me that you spend so much money in season 8, because you filmed two versions: the joke version (the one we are watching now), and the real version written by grownups with common sense.
I stopped having any expectations since season 7, and yet you continue to amaze me with your stupidity. I can write for hours about plot holes, plot armors, idiotic dialogues, lack of congruence to character arcs or developments, Hollywood moments. Other reviews have covered these problems more fluently than I could, especially now that I could not care less.
GoT was my favorite show. I can't wait for it to be over, and for D&D to never work in TV again."
704," I almost cried how bad this is.
",2,False,"This is not GOT anymore. The beginning was fine, thats the only reason I didn't give 1 star. Everything else is a complete mess. 15-20 minutes of unimportant feast and they couldn't give us 15 seconds pf heartwarming farewell between Ghost and Jon? Or the moment when Jon tells Arya and Sansa that he is Aegon Targ., the most important acknoledgement in the series and they do it off screen??? For 8 seasons we have been waiting to find out what did Night King want and in this episode there is no single line about him... Dialogs between the characters are as if were written by children, everything is so forced, 90% of the dialogs are just random and unimportant gibberish between the characters and are not contributing to the development of the season. There is no logic in Rhaegals death, they were flying high in the sky and could not see the whole fleet approaching? How the F are those scorpions so precise to shoot him 3/3 times from that distance, but they miss drogon, who came much closer, with every shot? I can't talk about this piece of ****, its not worth anymore of my time."
705," Too disappointed to type up a full review.
",5,False,"Let me just say this.
Season 5 and 7 were considered ""bad"" by GoT standards. Season 8 so far, and this episode in particular, are ""bad"" by T.V standards. This isn't a bad GoT episode, it's actually a bad episode.
You get me?"
706," Shame
",1,False,"I think it says a lot that many viewers have never written a review before but have suddenly felt compelled to do so now. I'm in that same boat (kind of like being on one of Dany's boats, helplessly watching something that was incredible sink before our very eyes). I won't even get into the various plot holes, plot armor, or questionable/unexplained/avoided directions in writing. They have been thoroughly pointed out already. The whole argument of saying those who are disappointed only because the ending is not what they expected, is nonsense. Many including myself, would probably have preferred an ending they didn't expect as long as it made sense in the whole scheme of things. When a majority of characters begin to seemingly act out of character that they have been built up to be for years, fans will obviously have an issue with this. Also to those suggesting that anyone with such sudden criticism must not be a true fan is a complete cop out. We are venting our dissatisfaction with the product of what the series has become because of our heavy emotional investment in it. We have grown to love the characters, how they have evolved and just wanted their arcs to be completed in a logical manner. So yea, the just stop watching if you don't like it argument isn't that simple. To me, this season has the feel of a show that had to replace all it's major characters last minute and thus never feels the same. The faces haven't changed though, and this is in no way a knock on the actors themselves. I have great respect for their amazing portrayals over the years. I have never read the books but often enjoyed reading much of the book lore to get a better understanding of things. Have also read many fan theories/predictions as a fun way to compare them to my own. Just as I have never written a review, I have never read a single show review of the series prior to this season. I never felt the need to as I didn't care what others thought, I always loved it for what it WAS. With all the hype, buildup, and extended wait, what they have presented us with honestly feels like a slap in the face and it questions our intelligence. Feels like we have been scammed or cheated. After reading other's reviews, it oddly gave me a small sense of relief in knowing I'm not alone in my utter, heartbreaking disappointment. I guess that is the most I could possibly expect now in regard to the bittersweet ending I never saw coming. Shame."
707," I pretty much loved everything the show had to offer. Up until this point.
",1,False,"I kind of expected it, for the writers to throw 7 seasons of build ups into the waste. But I didn't expect it would be this bad.1) Jon was always the light in the darkness to everyone. He's the character you'd look-up to when you lose hope in everyone else. He's always the salvation of the entire story. He does what he does because he believes in it. Yet in this episode and the last, I can't help but feel he's reduced to a publicity stunt whemp. In the Long Night, he virtually did nothing, like at all despite the build up of an entire story revolving around him being the one to save the day. Except, he was shouting at a dragon when the day was saved by the character with no build-up towards the storyline (Jon was always the one concerned with the NK, Arya heard of him basically after everyone else did). Then he goes to lick Dany's boots in what only appears to be degrading. He had seen her thirst for ruling. He looked her in the eyes and saw in them how the Iron Throne is the ONLY thing she cares about. He had seen in her eyes that she isn't very different than any power-hungry rulers he had met before. Yet, he decides to keep supporting her when he knows it is not the right thing to do. For the first time ever, I feel disgusted by Jon Snow. I've never thought my favorite character could become this ... thing.2) Dany had a bit of goodness in her. She seemed to be a good ruler. She would go at lengths to ensure her people do not suffer. Yet we see her reduced to Cersei's level in a matter of literally 5 minutes. For seasons they give us reason to believe she actually cared for anyone. Then in 5 minutes they take that entirely away. What? She lost her dragon? Or what she calls her son? How is she ANY different from Cersei? Everything Cersei did, she justified it by convincing herself it was for her kids. Now we got another raging power-hungry maniac who was supposed to be a good one. Yeah great storytelling.3) How do you ambush a dragon roaming the SKIES? There was NO WAY she couldn't see the enemy ships. It's NOT possible. Their battles/engagements have always felt crappy, but this is a whole new level of low. Also, how do you suddenly write-off a dragon (A DRAGON FFS) in 30 seconds of screen time? Idk, maybe if we got less scenes about drunk people getting more drunk, and more build-up towards a dragon dying...4) How was Missandei kidnapped? Shooting a bunch of ships from afar is one thing, going in there looking for one particular person is another. None of those important details were shown at all. It's like the script said: ""ambush, dragon dies, Missandei kidnapped. Back to kingslanding, Missandei is in chains"". I bet the real script wasn't much different.5) Jon throwing a bombshell on Arya and Sansa suddenly switches to blackscreen. Yeah, great cheap way of not putting any effort into showing the reaction of something this big. Really well-done.The writers have to pull a miracle to come back from this mess.By the end of this episode, it felt like watching Days of Our Lives."

How many times in your life you have seen movie/TV show character says: ""I'm not drunk"", and then gets up and almost falls with following up ""Maybe a little"" ? I almost puked here. Marriage proposal was also so childish and cheesy, as well as Jamie's flirting with his lady.So many pointless dialogues and then crown of every irrational thinking: Dragons getting AMBUSHED ON OCEAN. God damn it. And after one dies, other dragon suddenly becames Neo from Matrix with avoiding 100 spears per second.

Who is this Jon just standing with the sword (or safely riding on a dragon in ""The Long Night"") on the dying street on King's Landing doing absolutely nothing?
Who is this Tyrion just delivering a few dialogs with conclusively no impact at all in anybody?
Who is this Cersei so helpless, so destitute, so impotent?Why am I feeling lost? Why such a feeling that this is not the show what we knew as GoT?Why D&D are in such a hurry to wrap things up in two episodes?Why suddenly there is so much hollowness in all the characters who had so persistently maintained their focus and spirit in all those seven episodes, and created this very bold and exciting series?Why this abrupt change of character of Dany who throughout maintained she is the Mother, she is the Meshiah, she came here to rescue all of us in this seven kingdoms from those tyrants? Only because Jon exposed the secret to his sisters and thereby to Tyrion and Varys, all of here life's philosophy got suddenly worthless? Only because Cersei beheaded Missandei, she lost all her idealogies? Just a sight of the Red Keep with Cersei standing over it, Dany lost herself? Where is that strong and admirable character?Why after so many years of preparation of this battle, after so many sacrifices, troubles, murders, plots etc., suddenly Cersei had just no defences? No strategies? No battle plans? All she could is just standing there and watch the dragon burn the city? Where is that merciless and shrewd Cersei who killed so many people along with the High Sparrow? Where is that Cersei who never accepts defeat without fight?Why so frequent and dramatic changes in Jaime? Once he realizes he ought to keep his promise to be with the right side, in the next moment his love for Cersei makes everything obsolete? And after so many armies, allies, threatenings, preparations only Jaime is there to rescue Cersei?How Euron killed a dragon just like that in ""The Last of the Starks"" and he doesn't know what to do when the actual battle took place? Just a few arrows missed and he is clueless? All of a sudden his ambition is to kill Jaime? Why? Because he knows Jaime is the only obstacle on the path to win Cersei?Why only one dragon is just enough to win the so long awaited battle? With no contribution from the frightful dothraki, the fearless unsullied? No Jon, no Davos, no Tyrion, no Brienne, no Grey Worm - nobody is required? Why didn't Daenerys just flew with all the three dragons intact, and burned the city and won the iron throne? So easy?
Where is the Game?
Where is our Game of Thrones?"
714," The right ending feels wrong
",7,False,"I try to keep this as short as possible:G.R.R. Martin had it right.
Selfish monarchs, wars, conquers and religious fanatics are bad and lead to harm. That's what GoT was all about.
It made a lot of sense for Dany to turn out as the ultimate threat being nothing like a every other conquer. It also made sense to end the long night before that.BUT D&D Hollywooded it up.
They underestimated how much people loved the complexity and realism of GoT. They made smart characters really stupid in order to help the story to end quickly. Plot twist feel rushed and unexplained.
Also Arya killing the NK is a joke. Decisions like that had nothing to do with the GoT lore and were made just to surprise, unlike Genius twists like hodor/ red wedding that made sense and kept developing the story.
Characters like Euron were introduced perfectly and ended up feeling like a meme.The issues that this episode has are not to blame on this episode but on the entire process starting mid season 7. Still it feels really unsatisfying and I didn't enjoy watching most of it."

",4,False,"Great acting, great production, and mind blowing CGI cannot make up for poor writing.""It's easy to do things that are shocking or unexpected, but they have to grow out of characters. They have to grow out of situations. Otherwise, it's just being shocking for being shocking."" -GRRM"
716," Visually compelling, but fatally undermined by the context
",1,False,"In some other world, thus episode might have made sense. Not this world though. The final battle for Kings Landing is a brutal affair, showcasing the complexity of pitched battle and trying to do the right thing.Visually, the episode is stunning, and if that's all it hinges on I might have given it higher. The problem though is that there is absolutely no sense for what happens. Daenerys descent into madness seems complete, as she inexplicably turns Drogon onto the innocent people of Kings Landing, despite having clearly won the battle.Indeed, even the battle loses some sense after the last episode, with Euron's fleet somehow being decimated in a minute, despite their near omnipotent presence in previous episodes. It is this lack of logic leaving me bewildered at how they could have messed this up.The scenes of carnage in KL are terrible and shocking; typical GoT fare. There is real tragedy when opposing soldiers face off, both exhausted by war, tired and no longer wanting to fight. Civilians huddled in buildings in a futile effort to avoid a fiery death. Arya's confusion and fear is real. If we didn't know the context, and just saw the city aflame, this would make potent drama.Alas, the show has performed its own Red Wedding on the narrative, so that the all the good stuff in the episode is just looking sad and pathetic. Cersei and Jamie's end might have been more tragic, were it not for the anti-Deus ex Machina of a cave-in preventing their escape. The final confrontation of the Hound and the Mountain would have had more zest, if it were not for the last minute 'revenge' instinct of Sandor (yes, it had been implied throughout the series, but this was the equivalent of a magician performing the greatest magic act ever, and then immediately explaining how they did it). Really, I saw no reason why he felt the need to pursue his brother at this point.The less said about Varys demise the better. Just jaw droppingly awful.So this final confrontation comes to an end, making no sense and with one episode left to go. I cannot imagine how such a great series got locked into this position, but it's such a bad taste that the whole thing now looks tainted. Why would I start from season 1, knowing where this nonsense is due to end."
717," Can we have season 8 reshoot? Please.
",4,False,Why is nothing making sense in this season?After a year and a half waiting and see the best show of all time to become just average. They ruined not just the show but the series as well. Avengers should time travel back to the future and get the final two books read to D&D before they shoot this season.
718," Why this episode made no sense.
",5,False,"First of all, I will say that this episode was visually stunning. Much better than Episode 3 where even max brightness couldn't do it justice. Also, CleganeBowl was a nice payoff and the right end for that arc. The music was great as always and the action scenes were done well.BUTThe main theme of this episode was Danaerys going full ""Mad Queen"". However this doesn't make any sense in the way it played out for her character. If you remember, she:Freed the slaves of Astapor (where she got the Unsullied)Freed the slaves of Yunkai (where the people worship her as ""Mhysa"" and ""Breaker of Chains"")Freed the slaves of Mereen and crucified the slave masters (as justice for them doing the exact same thing to the slaves)Locked up her dragons when she hears they had killed a childContinually insists that she ""knows what my father was"" and repeatedly declares ""I am not him""Decides to help Jon defend Winterfell rather than going straight for the ThroneSo, when Kings Landing surrendered why would she then throw her entire legacy away and burn every house in the city? If she was so ""mad"" then why not go for Cersei whom her anger was directed and destroy the Red Keep only? - this would be a mistake anyways due to collateral damage but would be more believable than torching an entire city (1 million people?) because she's in a bad mood.Danaerys was always portrayed as a kind-hearted but also dangerous ruler who put the people first and pledged to ""rid the world of tyrants"". Given her experience in power and history of justice, she would not be so stupid to burn an entire city she was destined to rule.. effectively committing suicide since she will obviously have no support now.Also, the battle itself was just silly. They had hundreds of overpowered scorpions on boats and around the city with only ONE dragon to target. A dragon siege should have been impossible. They clearly made that obvious in Episode 4 where Drogon narrowly avoids getting arrowed but now, all of a sudden, the scorpions received a huge damage and accuracy nerf to the point where they didn't even matter. Big inconsistency in two consecutive episodes!Jaime and Euron was a random whatever... and as poetic as Jaime & Cersei's death was, it is undermined by the whole Kings Landing Genocide plot.Jon has barely shown any emotion or passion this entire season. ""You are my Queen, I will serve you"". Where's the fire he had as Lord Commander? No debate on strategy or any final inspiring words for the Mother of Dragons the night before the last battle? Jon seems a shell of his former self and has been a passenger most of the season. What exactly did the Lord of Light bring him back for?It is clear Danaerys will now die next episode, probably at the hands of Jon. I feel it was a poor end to her character.Emilia Clarke even said in an interview where she was asked how she felt about her final scenes this season. She hesitated and sarcastically said ""best season ever!"". She also said in a separate interview that she ""walked around aimlessly for hours"" after reading the final script. It's now clear why. Her character has been unfairly destroyed for shock value with a poor and rushed execution. She's clearly disappointed, as am I."
719," A visual masterpiece with mediocre writing

YES.If you just want action, lots of fighting and explosions then this is the episode you are going to enjoy. But if you want a logical story line without plot holes, a poor plot amour and strong character development (or endings), then no. The story line is very obviously rushed and you can tell that D&D has put little thought into writing a script that could match the levels of the earlier seasons, instead they opted for a more cinematic approach with impressive visuals."

",2,False,"If the show runners wanted SO BADLY to resolve the story via ""The Mad Queen"" narrative, they needed more than 4 episodes to build up to it.
When the surrender bells rang out and Dany made the decision to burn down King's Landing, I literally had to restart the episode to see if there was something I was missing. You spent 7 seasons building a character up to be merciful, intelligent, and graceful. You really expect the audience to forget all of that after 4 episodes of half-baked ""Dany won't listen to anyone!"" scenes?
Simply put- when she decided to do that, it made no sense. It needed to. The moment of the show with the most kairos failed for me, and I am honestly a little sad that I wasted so many years on this show. I'm going to just imagine the show ended after Season 6 and be content.The only reason I have any stars was to give credit where credit is due. The stunt coordinators, special effects team, and set designers did an incredible job. I just wish it was on a better episode."
723," Years of character building thrown away for shock value

724," A glorified view of how bad writing can be
",3,False,"I'm absolutely disgusted at the way the writing is being handled this season. Everything's condensed so it feels rushed, non-sensical and out of character. Don't get me wrong, ""When a Targeryen is born, God flips a coin"" and this ""Mad Queen Dany"" narrative is something I did believe could happen at one point or the other but the way it was handled was absolutely horrifying and ridiculously unfair to her character.Dany in S5-S7 showed some vast improvement and development in her character to make compromises for the better good. She made compromises with the masters back in Essos to keep the peace there, she listened to Tyrion for a more ""diplomatic"" way to handle the matters there. In S7, she even showed significant maturity by the fact that she was willing to look past the hatred she had for the Lannisters and the Starks (yet not forget it) just so she could risk her army numbers to preserve the life of the innocents in Westeros. After all that it MAKES NO SENSE that she'd go on a rampage and kill thousands of innocents in the final moments of the penultimate episode of the series right after she had more or less won the war and the Iron Throne. This episode completely ignores every bit of character development she had in the past seasons.""She lost her dragon, her most trusted confidante, her advisors were scheming behind her backs, so she went mad"" - This reasoning is also half baked and makes very little sense considering she was sold and then BETRAYED by the brother she worshipped, lost her unborn child, her husband back in the first season. Did she go mad then? No. She didn't even show a figment of this supposed Madness back then.Forget Dany. What the hell was the point of inclusion of Euron's character when she did nothing on the show? From the moment he came on the show, his character did nothing. I mean NOTHING. The Iron Fleet in this episode was destroyed a matter of seconds. Chalking up to the fact that his character was redundant and just there to hog screen time. To end it, he wasn't even an entertaining character to watch!Let me summaries some horrid writing moments in this episode:
1. How the heck did Rhaegal die? When Drogon was able to destroy the Golden Company and the whole of Iron Fleet in a manner of seconds??? It MAKES NO SENSE.Not to mention he topped it off by burning the whole of King's Landing SOLO!
2. If they really wanted a ""Mad Queen Dany"" why the heck did she not burn everything back when she arrived in Westeros? She had THREE DRAGONS back then. She would've easily won the war then by how they showed the strength of Drogon in this episode.
3. What was the point of whole Jaime's character development when they eventually made him snivel back to his sister?? What was the point of whole Jaime-Brienne relationship?S8 has so far been mediocre, but the horrendous writing in Episode 5 easily surpasses everything bad the S8 has seen so far. For now it's all about glorying Arya and Jon Snow. No other character matters, only those two.On the upside, if one's able to overlook the atrocious writing the episode was the most visually stunning episode of the show so far. The special effects was incredible, the cinematography and the acting everything was top tier."

",10,True,"We should be happy that those who are stark raving mad about GoT and this episode specifically do not have any dragons at their disposal (or so I hope). Receiving masses of negative commentary on one of the best pieces of TV entertainment in history is after all preferable to a fiery death.
I can not for the life of me imagine who anyone can perceive character archs unfulfilled in this episode - The hound, Jaime, Cersei, Arya, Daenerys - all of them had very satisfying ends or turns in their development in this episode, all of which made perfect sense.But mostly I would like to point out the extremely powerful message behind all the carnage that the fuming masses seem to ignore. It is what the books and series have always been about - power corrupts, there are no winners in the high stake political games of those in power and those who suffer most are usually the innocent and powerless
So many stories have revolved around ""great"" conquerors -Djengis Khan, Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar etc- all of whom got famous because they slaughtered countless people on their way to power. Bronn even spelled it out for all of us in the previous episode - kill thousands and they make you a king.
The Song of Ice and Fire has tricked us into taking the role of one of these conquerors and in the decisive moment of the conquest we se the heinous carnage that is the reality of war and without actually seeing her, we see what a monster Daenerys has become in her ruthless rise to the most powerful person in the known world.
Has this been foreshadowed? More that enough - everybody could get the hint from season 1 onwards. Remember the golden crown and Drogos promise to his Khaleesi. Later, there have been several occasions in which she only acted with mercy and compassion when she got what she wanted. But when she was denied her will, there was always talk of fire and blood that would rain down on all who oppose her. Everyone who says this came out of nowhere has not been paying attention. That too was spelled out for everyone by Ramsay Bolton.This story does not a happy ending, because that would be the wrong ending."
732," Mixed feelings: The Dragon can be seen as a metaphor
",6,False,"Hard to use words to describe how much this show has changed. GOT became iconic because its complex characters drove the plot. You were shocked when you saw the red wedding or the origins of Hodor but you could trace it back to its origins. I'm not going to be extreme and have a huge go at this show because the truth is I'm saddened by its current path. Now we have characters being forced to fit within a plot, character development tossed aside as if it meant nothing.The story arc for Dany becoming the mad queen was not only forced it was illogical. Dany has been suffering her whole life and come out stronger, hard to believe a few recent bad turns would turn her mad. Lets also not forgot how the Night King and White Walker story line still remains the biggest missed opportunity. It was also anticlimatic to see Cersei die the way she did after all she's done. Shock value can only carry you so much. When season 8 started I said how are they going to wrap up this universe in 6 episodes. Now I'm thinking what's left?Drogon is a metaphor in a way. The city and buildings that he took down so fast without thinking can be how the show runners have mindlessly torn down years of character development, potential and fan goodwill."
733," What happened...
",1,False,"I'm in complete denial that this is the actual season 8, it must be a joke, right? Everything of the last season's (the build up, twists, depth,...) gone..."
734," Season 8 is a slippery slide going from bad to worse.
",3,False,"I wouldn't have believed I would give a bad review of Game of Thrones. It is because I love this show so much that I have to be brutal in my review of this season.
It is clear that as soon as soon as Martin's source material ran out at the end of season 5, the show'a writing became progressively untrue to the core of ASOIAF. Sure, season 6 was a much anticipated and I think well received season as we got to see The Red Woman work her 'magic' in bringing her presumed ""Prince that was promised"" back to life.We cannot dispute some of the most formidable episodes following season 5 such as The Battle of the Bastards, The Spoils of War and of course, The Light of the Seven.I do have to say that however cinematically exquisite the show is throughout, I really do believe that the best writing of the show died with John Snow in Mother's Mercy.It pains me to think of how fans react so intolerably to this season (and rightly so) but without regarding the exclusion of the crew, production team, costumes and the incredible actors that have breathed life into this story for so many years."

Writing 2/10I love the creators attempt to show the horrific side of war in this with the commoners' point of view. This was the most stunning episode of the show with some of the best editing in tv.What went wrong?I still don't understand why dany went mad out of freaking blue. I like tge idea and it seems that the books are going on the same direction. But they could've executed her going mad much better.
I don't understand why Jamie went back to save Cersei.
I hate the plot armor.
I hate how Dany just ignores Tyrion's bad decisions ONCE AGAIN.
And dear lord I hated Euron from the beginning to the end. His entire plot was just to make some jokes and kill a dragon. No history, no reasoning. Just a comical villain.This could've been way way better."
736," Why do I still bother watching?
",5,False,"I feel sorry for the actors/actresses, they must be so disappointed with how their story arcs have ended, except Euron, his was terrible to begin with and nothing like the books. I actually felt nothing for the deaths in this episode, it just felt forced and rushed. I was angry with Jon and Tyrion but I put that down to bad writing, they were just following orders. As for Dany, I could accept her story arc, but it was done so rushed and terribly written that I feel for Emilia Clarke who must be as disappointed as I am. Jon has become a lap dog who can't see past his nose, Tyrion and Verys who were once so clever and so scary in their cunning are now terrible at everything they do. Poor Jamie, went from hated to sympathized to hero to wtf very quickly. A very sad arc to all their story lines.
I was going to buy the complete collectors set once it was released but I plan on just sticking with the first 4 seasons as they were a completely different show to what I've witnessed the last couple of seasons. My rant over, you can stop calling me dramatic but that won't take away my disappointment."
737," Worst than Dexter
",1,False,"The decay in the quality of writing is mesmerizing. Please put GRRM on suicide watchlist because D&D just butchered his life's work.I didn't think it could get worse, but you've outdone yourselves.what keeps me going? Mostly Hate at this point.I will never watch anything D&D do in their whole damn lives. You need to take a good hard look at what you've done."
738," HBO wanted 10 seasons. GRRM wanted 12. D&D wanted Star Wars.
",3,False,"Its sad that one of the best TV shows of all time concluded the way it did. The ending wasn't bad, but the 7 season buildup only to have this mad dash to the end is awful. Nothing was explained, nothing was written well, terrible pacing! Absolutely disrespectful to fans! This last season makes it really hard to recommend the show to new viewers or repeat viewings. If the writers didn't care why should we?"
739," A Message to Dan and Dave
",1,False,"Dear Dan and Dave,I have long been a huge fan and an avid supporter of Game of Thrones all the way since Season 1, granted I regretfully have not had the joys of reading any of the wonderful George RR Martins books. I have, however spent hundreds of hours exploring the Game of Thrones lore, history of Westeros, fan theories, detailed interviews and everything in-between - It's fair to say I'm a more passion fan than most.I am no Hollywood writer - or in fact any writer for that matter - but I believe I share the opinion of so many GoT fans. I want to start off by saying thank you. Thank you to the visual effects crew, stunt co-ordinators, body doubles, extras, set designers, costume designers, camera men, George RR Martin, directors, the brilliant actors and so many other people behind the scenes of this once all-time great show - Not only have we the fans been incredibly let down, but the people who have put their physical blood, sweat and tears into the show have also had their beautiful hard work defiled.I could go into incredible detail about all the things wrong with this season, some notable events: Jon being exiled for killing Danny who murdered hundreds of thousands of innocent people, Jon's heritage being seemingly not important, the woeful execution of Danny going mad, Bran being king even though he didn't do anything at all, Drogon flying off into the 'sunset', Rhaegal being killed, missing the reaction of Sansa and Arya's when Jon revealed his real parents and most of all for me, no one sticking up for Jon in the meeting with all the powerful lords... He literally killed the woman he loved and saved countless lives in the process and he gets nothing in return, its shameful.With the holes in the show - and there as so many - I think it's a pathetic excuse of an ending. HBO wanted 10 seasons, but foolishly Dan Weiss and David Benioff decided they had enough, they wanted to wrap the show up so they could make mountains of money butchering yet another beloved franchise (Star Wars). I understand that not everything deserves a happy and perfect ending, nor can you please everyone. However, we spent nearly a decade following these wonderful characters, watching them develop and intelligently interact with each other since season 1. The ending to this show will never be forgotten, for the wrong reasons unfortunately. I hope Dan and David come out and apologise to the fans, we are the people that kept the show running, without the fans support there would have been no Game of Thrones on TV at all.The characters deserved better. The whole crew deserved better. The fans deserved better. George deserved better.Regards,A Game of Thrones fan"
740," This show became a Meme
",2,False,"The Good things:
Music. Better than ever.Work Behind Cameras. It can´t be denied.Acting, despise of the poor writing.Arya, the Hound and Jorah were the few characters who behaved consistent.The Bad Things:
S08E01 and S08E02 filler episodes with dumb fan services scenes.S08E03 was a joke. Nobodody saw anything thanks to HBO, the Night king was a joke, everybody had plot armor, a lot of dumb fan service scenes, nothing really happened that affected the lore in the long term.. Dothraki´s charge was just stupid. The entire plan to defend Winterfell sucked.
Bran made no sense the entire season. We never really understood his purpose. Why did he warg during the battle of winterfell?S08E04, another filler episode. Euron´s fleet was full of Hawkeyes.So DAENERYS kinda forgot about Euron. Really????S08E05, Euron´s fleet became a bunch of Stormtroopers.So Daenerys destroyed the entire fleet with no problems at all. Why didn´t she do that in S08E04 after they killed her dragon? The ships were attacking her fleet, so she could easily flied up and then she justo does the dive bombing thing. Euron could have still survived, killed a dragon, and he coul still capture MESSUNDAE in the beach. The he could have said to Cersei ""We lost half our fleet but we killed a Dragon and captured this girl"".So the city surrenders easily, and Daenerys became Anakin Skywalker. Made no sense. It made sense for her to become the mad queen, but not that way.So what´s the point of the letters that Varys wrote? Useless.S08E06, so nobody mentions that Jon is the true heir to the throne, not even during the election of a new king.Daenerys´s death was cheesy.During the election of the new king and during the council reunion, GOT turned into a Sitcom, a bad one.Jon was ruined this season. He was foolish, dumb and with bad lines.Tyrion was like Sherlock Holmes during S01-S06. He turned into Lestrade.Bronn´s arc made no sense.Sadly, Euron´s arc made no sense at all.So Cersei and Jaimie could have survived if they wanted. they just needed to move a little.I could go on..."

NOT THERE! Jon Snow was so bland as to be almost lobotomized. Bron, Sam, Davos, Sansa, Arya, Yara Greyjoy, Brienne - all sitting around in that nothing scene - it was like the actors were there, but no one had given them any lines for their characters; because all the characters had disappeared into some talent sucking ether.To say the dialogue was like in a bad soap opera is too generous.Clear D&D just wanted to get this over with.

Toph completely forgets about metal bending and never uses it again despite plenty of situations where it would've obviously been useful. All the Airbenders are inexplicably back for the final battle despite all being dead. Katara goes crazy and destroys Ba Sing Se before being killed by Aang. Momo then becomes the new Firelord.

748," 6 months later and I still can't get over this
",2,False,"Man, every time I tell myself I'm over this show, something new about it pops out and I get sad, so I came back here to express how I felt a few months back when my favorite show crashed and burned into smithereens.I gave this show the benefit of the doubt so many times. People started doubting this show starting Season 5. I still gave it a chance. People started turning on it worse in Season 7, but I still stood tall for this show. I DEFENDED it through despite it's lows like Dorne, Sansa & Ramsay, Stannis, and title episode ""Beyond the Wall"", the Winterfell plot in S7, Littlefinger and whatnot because I put enough faith in David Beinoff and Dan Weiss to end this show beautifully because we were given 6-7ish good years of television. Why can't we now?Well, I got my answer in the worst way possible. I still can't believe the nosedive of the quality in the show. So much wrong for so many absurd reasons that it doesn't take any casual viewer with 2 brain cells to see what the hell is going on. I have never in my life seen so many characters ruined in just an hour and 30 minutes. It almost makes what M. Night Shalyman did with the Avatar The Last Airbender characters look good, and he BUTCHERED the characters from the original source. But my god, D&D...What the Hell were you thinking when you were writing this? That we'd enjoy it? That the fans would understand it made sense? I have made a few arguments in the past for some of the downtrodden plots/episodes of this show (Except Dorne and Sansa) but this season was a catastrophic failure and embarrassment to everything.From everything that has been coming out lately, you have been given so many chances. So many opportunities to make this better. And what did you do? You ignored it for the sake of that Disney money, which means NOTHING since you left that behind as well.
It doesn't matter if you don't care about this show anymore, MILLIONS of people including me have dedicated our Sundays in spring YEARLY to watch a new episode of this show that you were given the responsibility to take care of. You were quite literally handed the best cast ever, the most dedicated crew, MILLIONS of cash and endless resources to make this show great. To give people a debate whether Breaking Bad, The Sopranos, or Game of Thrones were the ""Best Shows of all time."" Matter of the fact is, we waited 8 long years to watch our investment pay off. To make sure our money was spent well. To make sure all of the endless conversations and research meant something to you. But it didn't.You broke the hearts of millions of fans around the world with that awful writing, and I will never watch a single thing that your names are on. Don't take those 2 stars I gave this episode in stride, for they are for GRRM and the hardworking crew and actors.The actors honestly had it the worst. Emilia, Conleth, Kit, Peter, Lena, Gwen and Nikolaj must've had it the worst. To have their beloved characters of 10 years of their lives be flushed down the toilet. To have their character sold out for cheap shock value. They deserved better.As for GRRM, It must've been sad for him to watch two nit wits destroy his life's work. He deserves better.WE the fans didn't deserve to have our money and time wasted by investing in this show. We deserve better.D&D, I dont care how many awards you guys get after this. Take that silly and undeserved ""Best Drama"" Emmy and go home and know that you both will go down in history for destroying this cultural landmark of a show and turning it into a meme made for mocking as everyone hangs their heads in shame talking about it. You guys blew it. And to add more salt to the wound, you can't even give your cast and (FORMER) fanbase the decent respect to give them an ending worth the near decade worth of investment into this series OR a proper explanation. Shame on both of you. Truly, shame on you both.(Edit/Update:) So it's May 2020, I'm currently in quarentine, and since I just binged all of the good shows I needed to catch up with and I currently have nothing better to watch, and I'm completely over my rage for GOT, I tried rewatching it for old times sake. My initial plan was to just stop at S6, but only 3 episodes into S1 and I HAD to quit. It's true, all it takes is one bad season to ruin an entire show. The entertainment value is shot. I'm watching and everytime the characters explain or tell a story about the lore of the universe all I can do is roll my eyes or yell at the TV and be reminded of how utterly useless everything that was established in the earlier seasons became in the final seasons. The legacy of this show is really ruined. Last year that was just my blind anger reviewing and speaking, now this is me talking from a calmer mindset than I was when the show ended. You can't even enjoy the GOOD seasons without being reminded of how useless everything became. There is no point to this show at all. This taint has carried over to the books for me as well because if the S8 ending is truly whats planned for the books, I don't want to waste my time. It's so sad now.Oh well, I wanted to just update my feelings about this show as we approach the one year anniversary of its disappointing conclusion. Mother's day last year was rage enticing for a lot of GOT fans since we watched the character assasinations of every remaining character on this show. Next week Sunday is the anniversary of this show's final destruction. Might as well give insight as to what the show looks like from fresh and calmer eyes a year later. Guys, it's not worth the rewatch at all.The best thing I can say about this show is that now, whenever you hate someone you can just recommend this show to them. Get them all invested to be disappointed by the time they spent binging and getting invested in the characters and stuff as a revenge tactic.I still stand by original rant review a year ago. My rating will remain at 2 stars just for sympathetic feelings towards the cast and crew. In my head, it's a -5 for D&D."

",3,False,"Forget all subplots, forget mystery around the White Walkers, forget The Faceless Men, Jon's heritage, forget that there once was logic and common sense in the series.
The show lost everything George R.R. Martin created - a complex world of utter fantasy and everyday life with politics, war strategies and basic human needs combined in a beautiful and authentic saga which you wish would never come to an end.
And the showrunners did everything in their power to ruin it. What a shame.3 stars for the music, actors' performance and a tearful last scene of Drogon with Dany."

Gods literally returned people from the dead so they could switch to a committee.The best programme on TV has the worst ending I've ever seen.

",1,False,"I guess I'll never get over it. This was my favorite TV show ever. And the final season is pure garbage. Even the 7th season is awesome compared to this. I remember that I almost couldn't finish it.
D&D destroyed this amazing world that we loved and got so much invested in just because they got tired of it and wanted to move on and make money somewhere else. Total disgrace and spit in the face of the fans. The characters are immensely dumb, the dialogues are pure cringe. The whole thing is rushed and doesn't make any sense. The ending is the worst ending they could have possibly gone with and the last episode is so boring that it's almost unbelievable. I was just praying for it to be finally over when I was watching it.
The actors definitely did their best, but the script was so terrible that they couldn't save it no matter how hard they tried. That one star is for the incredible music by Ramin Djawadi, the only thing that stayed with us till the end and didn't disappoint. The music and the memes were the only good things about the last season. How sad is that?
If you're new to the show, don't even consider watching it. Seriously, just don't bother. Because the writers didn't bother either. In the end, you'll only be left with huge disappointment. In the end, nothing that was established in the previous seasons matters. Right after the final episode, I was filled with anger, asking myself how is this possible, how could HBO let this happen. Now, year and a half later, I'm just sad."

At some point, I can almost say that I was almost happy to say the series is over. Why does such a series end up so bad? Character development was ignored. Very big disappointment. It would be better if Drogon and Ghost made sex in the final.I would have preferred a finale that was left open but created a big effect. We didn't need to know what was happening to every character, that they were all happy and strong. Almost democracy was coming. I couldn't see the finale that was bittersweet. The creators of the series once again proved how unsuccessful they were without a source. You can see this difference in diplomatic sentences easily by opening a random episode from the first three to four seasons of the series. 1/10"

I've been with this show from the very beginning. I watched in awe as Ned Stark was beheaded, the red wedding came to a bloody climax, Jon Snow was betrayed and stabbed to death for doing what he thought was right. None of that was 'subverting my expectations.' It was good, quality storytelling that stayed consistent with the progression of each character's storyline and showed who the characters were and would do. In this last season, we've seen characters act out in ways that are completely inconsistent with how they've acted the entire series prior. We watched the story arcs of Jaime, the hound, and Dany all become completely null and void. We watched Jon Snow become a glorified extra, demanding the question why he was even brought back from the dead. We watched the night king become a B-movie villain. We watched the character assassinations of greats like Varys, Cersei, and Tyrion. We did not get one semblance of a satisfactory ending and there's nothing you can say that will justify this lazily thrown together abomination that is game of thrones season 8. This show now officially has the worst ending of any show in the history of television and we're right to be angry."
761," A parody ending to what was a brilliant series
",1,False,Season 8 has been a complete disappointment.The final episode is a disgrace. The way they have butchered story lines such as us seeing Dany for 7 seasons being trained how to rule to suddenly becoming the Mad Queen. Jon whose only purpose is to say uh dunt wunt it and has been borderline useless since he was resurrected.The finale is what a 14 year old fanfic would end it as.D&D ruined the series as soon as they ran out of material from GRRM.
